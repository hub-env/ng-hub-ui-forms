# hub-select — vendored ng-select patches

This directory vendors the `src/ng-select` library from
[ng-select/ng-select](https://github.com/ng-select/ng-select) (see `UPSTREAM` for the pinned
version) as the foundation for `hub-select` and the upcoming ng-hub-ui selection-component family.

The vendored source under `vendor/` is kept **as close to upstream as possible** so that the
automated sync (`.github/workflows/sync-ng-select.yml`) stays low-conflict. Every intentional
deviation from upstream MUST be listed here, with the reason, so it can be re-applied quickly when a
`subtree pull`/copy from a newer upstream tag produces conflicts.

## Conventions

- **Do not rename** upstream classes, selectors (`.ng-select*`) or files. Theming and behavior are
  layered on top from the `hub-select` wrapper + the hub theme, not by editing `vendor/`.
- Hub theming lives **outside** `vendor/` (in `select/theme/`), targeting the stable `.ng-select`
  classes via `--hub-select-*` tokens — so upstream SCSS changes don't conflict.
- If a change to `vendor/` is unavoidable, keep it minimal and record it below.

| 1   | `vendor/**/*.ts`                    | Prepend `// @ts-nocheck` as line 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ng-hub-ui compiles under a stricter `tsconfig` than ng-select (strictNullChecks, strictPropertyInitialization, noImplicitAny, noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature, isolatedModules) → ~100 type errors. The code is already type-checked upstream; `@ts-nocheck` keeps the source byte-identical except line 1 and avoids invasive edits that would conflict on every sync.                                                                                   | 2026-06-13 |
| 2   | `vendor/lib/ng-select.component.ts` | `ng-select-opened` is reflected imperatively (`_reflectOpenState` via `Renderer2`, called synchronously from `open()`/`close()` + an `effect` for `[isOpen]`-driven writes) instead of the upstream `'[class.ng-select-opened]': 'isOpen()'` host binding, which is removed from `host`. | `open()` ends in a LOCAL `_cd.detectChanges()`: the own template updates (panel, `aria-expanded`) but host bindings — which execute during the PARENT view's refresh — do not, so in apps without a global tick after the interaction (zoneless / OnPush islands) the class never appeared and the theme's caret flip never engaged. Regression spec: `select-opened-class.spec.ts` (fails against the upstream host binding in a plain zone-based TestBed). | 2026-07-30 |

| 3 | `vendor/lib/console.service.ts` | `warn()` returns early unless `isDevMode()`, and prefixes the message with `[ng-hub-ui-forms]`. | The two call sites (`_isValidWriteValue`) report a model the engine is about to drop — worth keeping, but addressed to whoever wrote the form. Unguarded they printed in production builds, i.e. into the console of the consuming application's users, who did not write the binding and cannot silence it. Gating the single writer covers both messages and leaves the call sites byte-identical to upstream. Regression spec: `select-console-silence.spec.ts`. | 2026-09-08 |

| 4 | `vendor/lib/ng-select.component.ts` | `selectTag()` guards the promise branch with the same `if (item)` the synchronous branch has, closes the panel up front when `closeOnSelect` is on, and reads `isOpen()` once into `wasOpen` before doing so. | An `addTag` that resolves with nothing — a creation dialog dismissed, a request refused — was selected anyway, so the field held an option built out of `null`. And an `addTag` that opens a modal left the panel hanging over it: appended to `<body>`, above the modal, covering the form the user had just been sent to fill in, until the promise resolved or forever if it resolved empty. `wasOpen` keeps the created item joining the list rather than standing alone, which closing first would otherwise have changed. Regression specs: `select-search-and-tagging.spec.ts`. | 2026-09-23 |

> The sync workflow re-applies patch #1 automatically after copying a new upstream tag (it prepends
> `@ts-nocheck` to any vendored `.ts` that doesn't already start with it).
