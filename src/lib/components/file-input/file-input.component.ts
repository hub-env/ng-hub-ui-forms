/**
 * Accessible file field with drag-and-drop, clipboard paste, per-file constraints, previews and
 * optional upload progress.
 *
 * A full `ng-hub-ui-forms` field: it extends {@link HubFieldControl}, so it binds with
 * `formControlName` / `ngModel` and shares the label, helper text and validation chrome with every
 * other control.
 *
 * The **form value stays native** — a `File` in single mode, a `File[]` in multiple mode, `null`
 * when empty — so it can be handed straight to a `FormData`. The rich per-file state (preview URL,
 * upload status, progress, error) lives in the {@link files} signal instead of contaminating the
 * control. Files the record already has (`currentFile`) are shown next to the picked ones but never
 * reach the value either.
 *
 * Constraints declared as inputs (`accept`, `maxSize`, `minSize`, `maxTotalSize`, `maxFiles`) act as
 * a **filter**: an offending file never reaches the value and surfaces through {@link rejected}.
 * They are enforced by hand rather than delegated to the native `accept` attribute, which only
 * filters the operating-system dialog and is bypassed entirely by a drop or a paste. To make the
 * *control itself* invalid — the right choice when a value can also be patched in programmatically —
 * add the matching validators (`hubAcceptedFiles`, `hubMaxFileSize`, …).
 *
 * Uploading is opt-in and transport-agnostic: register a {@link HubFileUploader} with
 * `provideHubFileUploader()` and the component drives progress, cancel and retry. With no uploader
 * registered it is a pure picker.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <hub-file-input
 *   formControlName="attachments"
 *   label="Attachments"
 *   [multiple]="true"
 *   accept="image/*,.pdf"
 *   [maxSize]="5 * 1024 * 1024"
 *   [maxFiles]="3"
 *   preview="grid"
 *   (rejected)="notify($event)"
 * />
 * ```
