# Changelog

All notable changes to `ng-hub-ui-forms` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [22.40.0] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **A lifted floating label is readable again.** Up at the top of the field it kept the
  placeholder's muted grey and faded to 90%, which measured 3.96:1 on a white field while the
  plain label of the field beside it sat at 15.43:1 — below the 4.5:1 WCAG AA asks of body text. At
  rest the label stands in for the placeholder and is still painted like one; once it lifts it is
  the field's name, the only thing left saying what the value means, so it now takes the same
  colour as any other label and no longer fades. It measures 15.43:1. `<hub-input>` and
  `<hub-select>` both, which floated the same label with the same two declarations. Colours change
  visibly — see `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (visual) — the chip of a multiple `<hub-select>` carries its remove cross after the
  label.** The vendored engine emits the cross first and hard-codes it there, so every multiple
  select in the catalogue read `× Spain` where the rest of the world reads `Spain ×`. There was no
  way out from outside either: the chip is the engine's markup, and the only slot that reaches it —
  `hubSelectLabel` — replaces the whole chip, cross included, so moving one glyph meant redrawing
  the affordance and re-wiring `clear`. The chip is a flex row, so the running order is now settled
  in the stylesheet. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

### Added

- **`--hub-field-floating-raised-color`** — the colour a floating label takes once it is up. It
  defaults to `var(--hub-label-color)`, so it follows whatever the form's labels are painted with;
  point it somewhere else for a design that wants the lifted label tinted (Material floats it in
  the accent while the field has focus, which this token is what you would use for).
- **`--hub-select-value-remove-order`** — where the remove cross sits inside that chip, as its flex
  `order` against the label's `0`. It defaults to `1`, which is the new default order; `-1` puts the
  cross back in front, for a design that wants it there or an application that would rather not move
  it yet. It is a token rather than an input because the answer belongs to the theme, not to one
  field: a form with six multiple selects should not have to say it six times.

## [22.38.0] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A control built through `hubFormControlAdapter` has a name again.** The adapter is how a
  library with no dependency on this one renders a real field — a table's search box, a paginator's
  rows-per-page select. It read `kind`, `type`, `placeholder`, `cssClass` and `options`, and dropped
  every route to a name the contract offered: `ariaLabel` was declared and applied nowhere, and
  there was no `label` at all. So the two controls a table builds reached a screen reader as "edit
  text" and "combo box", in every application that wired it. `HubFormControlConfig` now carries
  `label` and `labelType`, and the adapter renders a real `<label for>` — clipped out of the page by
  default, because a control built into somebody else's chrome has no room to draw one. A host that
  only has an `ariaLabel` to give gets that instead of nothing.

    A label is the better of the two where a host can give one: it also answers to voice control and
    survives a page translation, and an `aria-label` does neither.

## [22.37.0] - 2026-09-23

Eleven open rows of the debt backlog, closed together because they are all the same package and
most of them are one line of surprise each.

### Added

- **`appearance="compact"` on `<hub-file-input>`.** The same field on one row — the browse control
  and the constraints — for the logo, the signature, the one small file that is not what the screen
  is about. The tall panel took half a dialog to ask for it, and turning the drag off did not help:
  the box, the glyph, the browse link and the constraints all stayed, and only the "drag here" line
  went. The row still takes a drop, so what goes is the copy that described one and not the
  behaviour. Tokens: `--hub-file-input-compact-min-height` (the shared control height),
  `-compact-padding-x`, `-compact-padding-y`, `-compact-gap`. A field that has to SHOW what it holds
  is `preview="inline"` instead — it needs room for the picture, and is sized through its own tokens.
- **`hubFileDrop` — a container, or a whole page, that takes dropped files.** A file field only
  accepts a drop inside its own box, which is right for a field and wrong for a screen: on a list of
  expenses the gesture is to drop the receipt anywhere on it. So every application that wanted that
  wrote the same component again, and the detail they all got wrong is the silent one — a file
  dropped where nothing is listening makes the browser open it and lose the page, half-filled form
  included. The directive watches the host and its subtree, or the whole document with
  `hubFileDrop="window"`; raises its own card while the drag is over the target; applies `accept`,
  `maxSize`, `minSize` and `maxFiles` and reports refusals in the same `HubFileRejection` shape a
  file field uses; and hands back what passed through `filesDropped`. `[overlay]="false"` keeps the
  behaviour and leaves the drawing to you, with `hub-file-drop--active` on the host to key on.
  Twenty-two `--hub-file-drop-*` tokens dress the card, which stacks above the modal layer because a
  screen can be a modal. Dragging is a pointer gesture, so the card is `aria-hidden` and the keyboard
  route stays the field's.
- **`(change)` on `<hub-select>`.** It emits the selected item — the whole object, not the bound
  value — which is what `ng-select` has always emitted under this name. Before, `(change)` on the
  element was an ordinary DOM listener: it caught whatever the inner search input happened to bubble,
  never fired for a value an asynchronous `addTag` created, and compiled without a word either way.
  The formats without an engine emit the same shape, so nothing has to know which one it is bound to.
- **`clearSearchOnAdd` reaches `<hub-select>`.** The engine has always taken it and falls back to
  `closeOnSelect` when it is not given — right until the two are wanted apart, which is exactly a tag
  field: it stays open to take the next value and still has to forget the term it just used. Binding
  it was an `NG8002`, so the only way to empty the box was to close the list you were about to type
  into.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (visual) — `<hub-segmented>` now stands at the height of a field.** It measured 43px
  beside a select's 38, and 33px at `size="sm"`, so a row of the two was out by five pixels whichever
  size was chosen. The only way to line it up was to deduce the track's internal padding and hard-code
  it, which stopped being right the moment the library touched its own spacing. There is one control
  height now — `--hub-field-control-min-height`, the arithmetic an `<input>` reaches by construction —
  and `--hub-select-min-height` and the new `--hub-segmented-min-height` both read it. `sm` and `lg`
  step one gutter either side of it (`--hub-segmented-size-step`). See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.
- **`--hub-select-option-marked-bg` is derived from the panel it sits in.** It read the elevated
  surface, which is a surface and not a relation: in a theme with a grey page and a white elevated
  surface the marked row came out the only white one in the panel, so it read as the background and
  everything else as highlighted. It is now an 8% mix of the option's own text colour over the
  dropdown background.

### Fixed

- **A `visually-hidden` label no longer escapes the field it names.** The clipped label is
  `position: absolute`, which only says where it is NOT laid out; where it ends up is the nearest
  positioned ancestor's business, and `.hub-field` declared no position, so with none anywhere up the
  tree it measured from the page. Inside a scroll container that put it at the bottom of everything
  and stretched the container's scroll height to reach it — a form that scrolled two thousand pixels
  past its own last field. The field is its own containing block now.
- **The create-a-value row no longer glues its caption to the term.** It printed the invitation and
  the typed term as two adjacent elements with nothing between them, so it read `Create tag"colour"`.
- **Choosing an asynchronous `addTag` closes the list at once**, rather than when the promise
  resolves. The panel is appended to `<body>` and drawn above the modal layer, so an `addTag` that
  opens a dialog left the list hanging over the very form the user had just been sent to fill in —
  and if the dialog was dismissed, the promise resolved with nothing and the list never closed at all.
- **No more `NG01354` per control inside a reactive form.** The fields drive their native control
  with an inner `[ngModel]`; the value the form holds travels through the ControlValueAccessor on the
  host, not through that binding. Angular cannot tell the two apart on its own — `NgModel` injects its
  parent with `@Host()`, which stops at the component boundary — so it warned once per control that an
  `ngModel` under a `formGroup` would not register. Eight controls in a dialog, eight lines of console,
  in an application whose author wrote none of them and could not silence them. The bindings are now
  declared standalone, which is what they already were and what the diagnostic reads.

## [22.36.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **BREAKING — the Angular floor rises from `19.0.0` to `21.0.0`.** The old range was
  measured from the source alone, and `AbstractControl` grew a third type parameter in Angular 21, and the published `.d.ts` carries the shape the compiler emitted, so the types cannot compile on an older one. An application below the new floor could install this
  package and then fail to build, with an error that pointed at Angular rather than here; it now
  gets the peer warning it should always have had. Nothing that worked stops working. See
  `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.
- **The floor is proved by running it now, not only derived.** `npm run floors:matrix` builds a real
  project pinned to the oldest Angular this package claims, installs it there, typechecks the
  published types against that version's `@angular/*` and runs that version's linker over the
  compiled output. It is what found this.

## [22.35.2] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **The Angular peer range now says what the code needs, not a number somebody picked.** It asked
  for `>=21.0.0`, which nothing in this package justified. The newest Angular API the source uses is
  linkedSignal() and afterRenderEffect(), which shipped in 19.0, and the partial-Ivy output the Angular linker checks carries no
  marker above it. The range is `>=19.0.0`, so applications on those versions can install this
  library instead of being turned away by a range that was never measured.
- **The floor is derived and checked from now on.** `npm run peers:floors` works it out from three
  things that can be verified — the Angular APIs the source calls, the `minVersion` markers in the
  compiled output, and the Angular types that reach the published `.d.ts` — and CI fails when a
  declaration drifts away from it again.

## [22.35.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- The repository moved to the `hub-env` organization. Issues for every Hub UI package are now
  gathered in [hub-env/hub-ui](https://github.com/hub-env/hub-ui/issues), and the `repository`, `bugs`
  and README links point at the new addresses. GitHub redirects the old ones.

## [22.35.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- **`preview="inline"`: the file sits inside the field.** A logo, an avatar or a signed contract is
  one file that belongs to a record, and the list under a dropzone was the wrong shape for it: the
  dropzone kept inviting a drop after the file was there, and the file itself sat below, small. An
  inline field is one tile that fills the field. An image the browser can paint is shown as the
  image; anything else is drawn as the icon of its family and its name. Hover, keyboard focus and a
  drag over the tile raise a "Replace" pill on a veil, and a remove button sits in the corner.
  With `multiple` the tiles form a grid inside the field, ending in a tile that adds more files;
  empty, the field is the usual dropzone.

    Clicking a tile opens its file: a picked image enlarges in a native modal `<dialog>`, a stored
    file opens its URL in a new tab (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`), and a picked file that is not an
    image opens in a new tab through an object URL created at that moment. Delete or Backspace on a
    focused tile removes it. With `maxFiles`, a counter reads "3 of 5 files", stored files in view
    included; at the limit the add tile goes away and drops and pastes are refused, while replacing a
    file is still allowed. In this mode the native `<input type="file">` sits after the tiles, outside
    the `<label>`.

- **`currentFile`, the file the record already has.** A URL, a `HubCurrentFile` (`{ url, name?,
type? }`) for a URL that does not reveal its name or type, or with `multiple` a list of either; a
  single field shows the first. Without a name, the name is the URL's last segment when it carries
  an extension, and the type is read from a `data:` URL. A stored file with no name at all is
  called after the field's label ("Remove Logo"), and "Current file" only when there is no label.
  In a field whose `accept` admits only images, a stored file of unknown type is treated as an
  image. Only `preview="inline"` shows stored files.

    **A stored file never enters the form value**, which stays a `File`, a `File[]` or `null`. When
    one leaves the field, removed or replaced by a picked file, **`currentFileRemoved`** emits it: it
    is the application's cue to delete it on the server. It stays hidden until `currentFile` changes.
    In a single inline field a new file, however it arrives, replaces the stored one; removing the
    new file afterwards does not bring the stored one back. `fileRemoved` now also emits a picked file
    that was replaced through its tile.

- **`imagePreview`** (default `true`). Off, every file is drawn as its family icon and no object
  URL is created for a thumbnail, in `list` as well. The lighter choice for long lists of photos.

- **`readonly` and `clearable` on `hub-file-input`.** A read-only field keeps its files in view and
  lets them be opened, but nothing can be picked, dropped, pasted, replaced or removed; unlike
  `disabled`, it keeps its focus and is still submitted. `clearable` (default `true`) decides
  whether the user may remove what the field holds, and it governs the remove buttons and "Remove
  all" of `list` and `grid` too.

- **File-family icons.** Ten families (`pdf`, `document`, `spreadsheet`, `presentation`, `archive`,
  `audio`, `video`, `code`, `image`, `generic`), told apart by MIME type first and by extension when
  the browser gives none. Each icon is a mask token, `--hub-file-input-kind-<family>-icon`, so a
  drawing is replaced by setting one custom property, and its colour by
  `--hub-file-input-kind-icon-color`, scoped per family through `[data-file-kind]` if wanted. The
  drawings are Bootstrap Icons 1.13.1 (MIT). `fileKind(type, name)` and the `HubFileKind` type are
  exported, with `HubCurrentFile`.

- **Seven `HubFileInputLabels` entries**: `removeFile(name)`, `open(name)`, `replace`,
  `replaceFile(name)`, `close`, `count(count, max)` and `currentFile`. The buttons over a tile name
  the file they act on, because "Remove file" alone does not say which one.

- **57 `--hub-file-input-*` tokens.** `-inline-width`, `-inline-min-height` and
  `-inline-aspect-ratio` size the single inline field; `-tile-*` dress every tile, inline and grid;
  `-tile-replace-*` and `-tile-veil-bg` the Replace layer; `-tile-action-*` the corner buttons;
  `-count-*` the counter; `-viewer-*` the enlarged image; `-kind-*` the family icons. An avatar is
  five of them: `-inline-width: 8rem`, `-inline-aspect-ratio: 1`, `-tile-radius: 50%`,
  `-tile-fit: cover` and `-tile-padding: 0`, with `accept="image/*"`.

- **A grid of swatches for `<hub-input type="color">`.** Give the field a list of colours through
  `swatches` and it draws them as a radio group the size of a field: one row is as tall as a text
  input, the cells share its width down to `--hub-input-swatch-min-width`, and past that they wrap
  onto more rows, where the field drops its box. The last cell opens the native picker for a colour
  outside the list; `[allowCustomColor]="false"` removes it for a closed palette, and
  `customColorLabel` names it. A swatch is a CSS colour string or `{ value, label }`; the label is
  what a screen reader says. Every entry goes through `parseColor` from `ng-hub-ui-utils` (hex,
  `rgb()`, `hsl()`, `oklch()`, `oklab()`, named colours); one it cannot read is dropped, with a
  `[ng-hub-ui-forms]` warning in development builds. The control receives the chosen string as
  written. The group is labelled by the field label through `aria-labelledby`, has one Tab stop and
  moves with the arrows, Home and End.

    Which field is drawn: `swatches` left at `null` takes the application palette, and with none the
    classic field; `[swatches]="[]"` asks for the classic field even under an application palette; a
    list draws the grid. A list in which no entry is a colour also falls back to the classic field.

- **`color` in `provideHubForms`** (`HubColorConfig`): `swatches`, the application palette, empty by
  default so colour fields keep the classic field; `customColorLabel` (`'Custom color'`); and
  `pickerLabel` (`'Choose color'`), the accessible name of the classic field's colour square.
  Merged like `password` and `fileInput`, which is how both names get translated.

- **`HUB_COLOR_PALETTES`**, five frozen lists of lowercase sRGB hex with an English name on every
  swatch: `tailwind` (17, Tailwind CSS v3 step 500), `material` (19, Material Design 2014 tone 500),
  `pastel` (17, Tailwind step 200), `neutral` (11, Tailwind `neutral` 50 to 950) and `status` (5:
  success, warning, danger, info, neutral). The record, each list and each swatch are frozen, so one
  application cannot repaint them for another. Also exported: `HubColorPaletteName`,
  `HubColorSwatch`, `HubColorSwatchInput`, `HubColorConfig` and `defaultHubColorConfig`.

- **14 `--hub-input-swatch-*` tokens** for the grid (size, minimum width, gap, radius, hairline,
  wrapped border and background, selection and focus rings, check mark, the custom cell's spectrum),
  plus `--hub-input-swatch-mark-color`, a hook that is not declared: leave it unset and each check
  mark is black or white, whichever reads on its swatch; set it and every mark takes that colour.

### Changed

- **The classic colour field is a hex text field now.** Up to 22.34.0, `type="color"` rendered the
  browser's colour button, 2.5rem wide. It is now a full-width field like any other `hub-input`,
  with the same height, border, radius, focus ring and disabled, read-only and invalid states: the
  hex code is editable text, and a square at its start shows the colour and opens the native picker.
  **Every existing colour field changes look without any code change.** The value is what it was: a
  valid colour reaches the form as it is typed, with or without `#`, three or six digits, stored as
  lowercase `#rrggbb`, the only notation the native picker accepts. Invalid text leaves the value
  alone and reverts on blur. A value in another notation written from the form (`rgb(…)`, a named
  colour) is shown as hex but not rewritten until someone types or picks. The square and the text
  are two Tab stops, in that order. Read-only, the square does not open the picker; disabled, the
  square, the text and the picker are all disabled.

    `.hub-input__control--color` is kept, but it is on the text `<input>` now, not on an
    `<input type="color">`: a stylesheet that sized the native button through that class now styles
    the text field. New classes: `.hub-input__color` (the wrapper), `.hub-input__color-swatch` (the
    square) and `.hub-input__color-native` (the hidden picker).

- **`--hub-input-color-size` is the width of that square**, and its default is the field's inner
  height, `calc(var(--hub-input-line-height) * var(--hub-input-font-size) + 2 * var(--hub-input-padding-y))`,
  so the square stays square and follows a theme's type and padding. Its height is always the
  field's. An application that set it keeps control of the square, in width only: `3rem` now gives a
  3rem-wide strip as tall as the field.

- **A colour field with `labelType="floating"` shows its label**, above the field as with `stacked`.
  Before, the native colour button with a floating label drew no label at all.

- **Every `hub-input` label carries an `id`**, `<field id>-label`, and binds `for` as an attribute.
  In every format but the swatch grid, `for` still points at the control as before. The grid's
  label has no `for`, since a `<label for>` cannot name a radio group; the group points back at it
  through `aria-labelledby`. An application that already gave another element that id now has a
  duplicate.

- **`preview="grid"` draws tiles**, the same tiles as `inline`, under the dropzone: the image or the
  family icon, the name, the Replace pill, the remove cross, and a click that opens the file. The
  file size is no longer shown, and the tiles take their look from `--hub-file-input-tile-*`: the
  `--hub-file-input-item-*` tokens now dress only the rows of `preview="list"`, so a grid themed
  through them loses that theme. **`--hub-file-input-grid-thumb-height` is now the height of the
  whole tile**, not of the thumbnail inside it; the default stays `6rem`. A projected
  `hubFileIcon` template no longer reaches the grid: tiles draw the family icon, and `hubFileIcon`
  now applies to `preview="list"` only. A projected `hubFilePreview` template keeps the previous
  list, laid out as a grid.

- **The dropzone sits inside a `div.hub-file-input__frame`**, in every preview mode, and the frame
  receives the drag events. A consumer selector that expects the dropzone as a direct child, such as
  `.hub-field__body > .hub-file-input__dropzone`, no longer matches.

### Fixed

- **No broken thumbnail for an image the browser cannot paint.** `list` and `grid` created a
  preview for every `image/*` file, so a HEIC, TIFF or PSD showed an empty frame. A preview is now
  created only for PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, SVG, BMP, ICO and APNG; the others get the image
  icon. **`HubFileItem.previewUrl` is `null` for those types**, and for every file when
  `imagePreview` is off: a `hubFilePreview` template that renders `previewUrl` has to handle `null`.

- **A `hub-select` dropdown appended to `body` that opened upwards no longer lands off-screen.** The
  upward branch set the panel's `bottom` from the bottom edge of `body`, but an unpositioned `body`
  is not the panel's containing block, so `bottom` resolved against the viewport-sized initial
  containing block and, on any page taller than the viewport, the panel ended up far from its field.
  Both directions now measure from the parent's top edge.

- **A button in a field's `hubPrepend` / `hubAppend` slot takes the field's border colour.**
  `hubButton` compiles `:host(.hub-btn-outline)` to the same specificity as the slot's rule, so the
  winner was whichever stylesheet the page injected last, and on one page an attached button kept
  its own grey outline next to an input's that wore the field line. The slot's rule now wins at rest
  on weight alone, and steps aside on hover and keyboard focus so the button's own hover border
  shows, as it always did.

## [22.34.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`hubSelect*` slots, so customising a `<hub-select>` no longer means writing the name of a
  vendored dependency.** The dropdown is built on a copy of ng-select kept under
  `select/vendor/` and re-synced from upstream, and the only way to re-draw a part of it was to
  import one of its `Ng*TemplateDirective` classes and write `ng-option-tmp`, `ng-label-tmp` and
  the rest. Those selectors are the engine's, not this library's: nothing here promises they will
  keep their names, and a consumer who wrote them was pinned to an internal detail.

    Twelve directives replace them, one for one, with the same template contexts:
    `hubSelectOption`, `hubSelectOptgroup`, `hubSelectLabel`, `hubSelectMultiLabel`,
    `hubSelectHeader`, `hubSelectFooter`, `hubSelectNotFound`, `hubSelectTypeToSearch`,
    `hubSelectLoadingText`, `hubSelectLoadingSpinner`, `hubSelectTag` and `hubSelectClearButton`.
    Nothing under `vendor/` was touched, so the automated upstream sync stays as low-conflict as it
    was.

- **Five of those slots now do something at all.** `ng-typetosearch-tmp`, `ng-loadingtext-tmp`,
  `ng-loadingspinner-tmp`, `ng-tag-tmp` and `ng-clearbutton-tmp` were exported from the entry
  point but never forwarded: written inside a `<hub-select>` they belong to the wrapper's content,
  and the engine's own `contentChild` cannot see through an `<ng-content>`, so they were silently
  inert. Their `hubSelect*` equivalents are forwarded like the other seven.

- **The legend of a `<hub-fieldset>` can be projected as an element.** `<hub-legend>` written as a
  direct child is lifted into the native `<legend>`, which is where the required marker and the
  invalid state live. It is the same element `legend="…"` now builds, so a text legend and a rich
  one produce the same DOM and the same classes.

### Changed

- **`<hub-fieldset legend="…">` renders its text inside a `<hub-legend>`.** The legend had two
  shapes that coexisted: the `legend` input drew bare text into `.hub-fieldset__legend`, and the
  `hubLegend` template slot drew whatever it was given — usually a `<hub-legend>`, which re-declared
  the same colour, size and weight from the same tokens one level down. Two DOM contracts for one
  element, with a silent precedence rule between them. There is one now. See
  [`BREAKING_CHANGES.md`](./BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

### Deprecated

- **The `hubLegend` template slot** (`HubLegendDirective`). Project a `<hub-legend>` instead. The
  slot existed only so a legend could carry markup, and `<hub-legend>` carries markup without an
  `ng-template` and without a second directive to import. Removed in **23.0.0**.

- **The vendored `ng-*-tmp` attributes and `NgOptionComponent`**, still exported and still working.
  Each template attribute has a one-for-one `hubSelect*` replacement. `<ng-option>` has `[items]`:
  it never worked through `<hub-select>` in the first place — the engine's `contentChildren`
  cannot see through the wrapper's `<ng-content>` either — so a consumer who wrote it got an empty
  list. Removed in **23.0.0**.

### Fixed

- **`getActiveElement()` no longer defaults its root to a `document` that may not exist.** Same
  crash on a server render as its twin in `ng-hub-ui-utils`, fixed the same way: the default is the
  global document when there is one, and the parameter accepts `null`.

- **Three doc comments claimed the select's catch-all `<ng-content>` carries `<ng-option>` through
  to the engine.** It does not, and the reason `[hubPrepend]`, `[hubAppend]` and the deprecated
  `[hubSelectSuffix]` are templates rather than projected content is the true half of the same
  sentence: the catch-all is declared first and opens straight into the dropdown, so anything
  projected plainly lands inside the panel.

## [22.33.2] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **The select's two write-value diagnostics no longer reach a production console.** The vendored
  engine refuses a model it cannot map — an object bound with `bindValue` and no `[compareWith]`,
  or a scalar handed to a `[multiple]` select — and drops it. Both refusals were announced with an
  unguarded `console.warn`, so the message landed in the browser of whoever was using the
  application rather than of whoever wrote the form, with no way to switch it off. They are worth
  keeping — a value discarded in silence is the harder bug — so they were not deleted like the two
  warnings 22.33.0 removed, which had somewhere better to be said: these describe a value the
  library is dropping right now, and there is no `@deprecated` tag or README line that can say it
  at that moment. `ConsoleService` now emits only under `isDevMode()` and prefixes the message with
  `[ng-hub-ui-forms]`, the shape 22.31.0 settled on. Nothing else changes: the same values are
  refused, in the same way, and the messages read the same in a development build.

## [22.33.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **The READMEs document `labelType="visually-hidden"`.** The value shipped in 22.33.0 and was
  written down in `FUNCTIONALITIES.md` and on the documentation site, but not in either README —
  so the one file a reader opens from the package itself still described three label types, all
  of which draw the label, and said nothing about the option that exists precisely for the case
  where drawing it is not possible. Both READMEs now cover it in the accessibility section, with
  the reason it is a hidden label rather than an `aria-label` and the two group fields that name
  themselves instead.

## [22.33.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **`labelType="visually-hidden"`, so a control without a visible label still has a name.**
  A design with no room for a label left only bad options: draw the label anyway, or ship an
  `<input>` with no accessible name — which is what a toolbar search box or a compact grid cell
  got, since the label input defaults to `''` and no field exposed `aria-label` or
  `aria-labelledby`, and an `aria-label` written on `<hub-input>` stays on the host and never
  reaches the control. The fourth `HubLabelType` value renders the label and keeps it bound to
  the control, then clips it out of the page — not `display: none`, which would take the name
  away with the pixels. Honoured by `hub-input` (checkboxes and switches included),
  `hub-textarea`, `hub-select`, `hub-datepicker`, `hub-timepicker`, `hub-otp-input`,
  `hub-slider`, `hub-segmented` and `hub-file-input`, which gains the `labelType` input it
  never had; on the dropzone `floating` and `horizontal` keep rendering the stacked label they
  always did, because it has neither arrangement to offer.

    **Two fields name themselves instead.** `hub-otp-input` and `hub-segmented` render a group of
    controls rather than one control, so there is nothing for `for` to point at: a `<label for>`
    aimed at a `<div>` is inert and names nothing. Both put the label text on the group through
    `aria-label`, which is what leaves them with an accessible name once the visible label is
    clipped away.

- **`FUNCTIONALITIES.md`**, the coverage table the rest of the family ships. The only feature
  matrix forms had lived in the documentation site, so nobody reading the package could tell
  what it supports or which parts a running example demonstrates.

- **The READMEs document `hub-timepicker`.** It shipped in 22.23.0 and was named only in
  passing, in two lists of fields that accept addons: the Fields overview omitted it and its
  `min` / `max` / `step` inputs were written down nowhere. The Spanish README also gained the
  cross-library adapter section and the dropzone subsection the English one has had, so the two
  say the same things again.

- **`fieldset[hubFieldset]`, so grouping a few fields costs one element instead of two.** The
  container was an element-only selector whose template emitted a `<fieldset>` of its own, so every
  group a consumer wrote came out as a `<hub-fieldset>` wrapping a `<fieldset>` — a box with no
  meaning of its own, sitting between a form's grid or flex container and the children it lays out.
  The component now also matches `fieldset[hubFieldset]`, the two-selector shape
  `ng-hub-ui-buttons` already uses, and in that form it dresses the host instead of emitting a
  second fieldset. Both forms take the same inputs and produce the same legend, the same
  group-level errors and the same classes, so moving from one to the other changes nothing but the
  tag; the attribute form is the one the READMEs and the documentation page now show. It is
  restricted to `<fieldset>` on purpose — on a `<div>` it would draw a legend over a group with
  none of the semantics assistive technology reads from a real fieldset.

### Removed

- **The two `console.warn` calls the library made into its consumer's console.** One announced that
  an inline `required` loses to the validators of the reactive control it is bound to; the other
  that `<hub-input type="file">` is deprecated. Both were addressed to whoever wrote the
  application, and both are already said where that person reads them — the `@deprecated` tags an
  editor surfaces on hover, the READMEs, `BREAKING_CHANGES.md` and this file — while the console
  copy could not be turned off by the only party it reached, who did not write it. Neither
  behaviour changes: the reactive validators still decide `required`, and the `file` format still
  works until the next major removes it.

### Fixed

- **The stylesheets the README tells you to import are now declared in `exports`.** 22.5.0 moved
  the SCSS to `ng-hub-ui-forms/styles` and announced that the documented `@use` resolved, but the
  manifest carried no `exports` field, so ng-packagr generated one from the entry points alone and
  the copied sheets were named nowhere. Angular's own CLI never noticed — it resolves SCSS through
  `node_modules` load paths and ignores `exports` — while any resolver that honours the manifest
  (`require.resolve`, a webpack `pkg:`/sass-loader setup, tooling that reads the map) got
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` for a path the docs teach everywhere. `./styles`,
  `./styles/index.scss` and the three theming mixins (`forms-theme`, `segmented-theme`,
  `file-input-theme`) are now declared explicitly, matching the shape `ng-hub-ui-ds` and
  `ng-hub-ui-avatar` already use.

- **The inline-`required` warning no longer reaches production consoles.** The notice that a
  reactive control's validators override the inline `required` input is advice for whoever is
  writing the form, so it belongs in development, where it can still be acted on. Unguarded, it
  became noise a consumer could not switch off in their own users' browsers. It is now behind
  `isDevMode()` and carries the `[ng-hub-ui-forms]` prefix, like the deprecated-`file`-format
  warning it sat inconsistently beside.

- **The READMEs no longer send a consumer to install `@angular/cdk`.** 22.25.0 dropped the CDK
  and the install instructions never followed: the Quick Start, the install command and the peer
  block all still asked for a package the library has not imported since, while `ng-hub-ui-utils`
  — the peer that actually is required, and the overlay the datepicker opens its panel with —
  was named nowhere. Two more claims a consumer could act on and fail were corrected in the same
  pass: the switch snippet, which showed `format="switch"` on a `<hub-input>` that picks its
  format with `type`, and the theming import, which pointed at `ng-hub-ui-forms/src/lib/styles`
  — a path 22.5.0 moved to `ng-hub-ui-forms/styles` and that resolves nowhere in the published
  package.

## [22.32.0] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **`HubInvertColorPipe` accepts any CSS colour and no longer throws.** It parsed hex only, and
  raised `Error('Invalid HEX color.')` on anything else — an exception thrown from a template,
  where nothing can catch it. It now resolves `rgb()`, `hsl()`, `oklch()`, `oklab()`, named
  colours and 4- and 8-digit hex through `parseColor()` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`, preserves alpha
  when inverting, and returns `#000000` for input it cannot resolve. Bare hex without the leading
  `#` keeps working.

- **`bw: true` now decides by perceptual lightness** rather than by the YIQ `> 186` threshold, and
  a third `metric` argument selects `'lightness'` (default), `'apca'` or `'wcag'`. See
  `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`: the returned colour changes for a large share of mid-light inputs.

## [22.31.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **`formTextType="tooltip"`: helper text behind a question mark at the end of the label
  row.** `formTextType` has been a public input on every field since the beginning and
  has only ever accepted one answer — `bottom` — so helper text has always been a line
  drawn under the control. That works for a sentence. It stops working the moment the
  text explains something: a paragraph under every field turns a form into a document,
  pushes the next field off the screen, and is read by nobody who already knew what the
  field was for. The rule the product settles on is **one sentence, below; more than one,
  tooltip** — and the second half of it had no implementation.

    Set `formTextType="tooltip"` and the label row becomes `label + (*) … ?`: the mark is
    pushed to the end of the row with an auto margin, so a column of fields lines its
    question marks up instead of scattering them wherever each label happens to stop. The
    block below stands down. Available on all nine fields that carry helper text —
    `hub-input`, `hub-textarea`, `hub-select`, `hub-datepicker`, `hub-timepicker`,
    `hub-otp-input`, `hub-segmented`, `hub-slider` and `hub-file-input`. `hub-segmented`
    gains `formTextType` in the process; it was the one field that declared `formText`
    without it.

    **The trigger is a `<button>` outside the `<label>`, deliberately.** Activating a label
    focuses the control it names, so a button nested in one would open the tooltip _and_
    jump the caret into the field — a shortcut nobody asked for, and one that reads as
    correct in a review. It sits beside the label in a `.hub-field__label-row` instead,
    which keeps it reachable by keyboard on its own. Its accessible name is the helper text
    itself, so a screen reader is told what a pointer learns by hovering, without waiting
    for a tooltip it cannot see.

    **The mark is drawn from CSS, not from an icon.** `ng-hub-ui-icons` is not a dependency
    of this package, and taking one on for a single glyph would make everyone who wants a
    text input install an icon set. It is a circle and a `?` built from
    `--hub-form-hint-size`, `-font-size`, `-font-weight`, `-color`, `-bg`, `-border-width`,
    `-border-color` and the three `-hover-` variants. The size is in `em` of the label, not
    in `rem`: the mark belongs to the label beside it, so a form that scales its labels down
    takes the mark with them.

    The tooltip itself is `[hubTooltip]` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`, already a peer dependency.
    Its element is appended to `<body>`, out of reach of this package's styles, so an
    application that wants it dressed needs the tooltip's own sheet:
    `@use 'ng-hub-ui-utils/styles/tooltip';`. Without it the mark still works and still
    speaks; only the label it opens comes out unstyled.

    Three behaviours worth knowing before reaching for it. A field with a **floating label,
    or no label at all**, still renders the row — the mark alone, at the end — because the
    helper text has nowhere else to go once the block below stands down, and dropping it
    silently is worse than a lone question mark. A **projected `hubFormText` template** keeps
    its place under the control even in tooltip mode: the tooltip carries a string, so
    handing it markup would throw the markup away without a word. And on a **checkbox or
    switch**, where the `<label>` wraps the control itself rather than pointing at it, the
    mark is lifted out into a row beside that label: nested inside it, activating the mark
    would toggle the control — and a switch carrying a two-sentence warning is precisely the
    one that must not flip because somebody asked what it does.

### Changed

- **`formText` and `formTextType` now live on `HubFieldControl`.** They were declared,
  identically, in each of the nine fields; the tooltip needed one derived state built from
  the pair, and nine copies of it is how the fields drift apart. No public API moves — an
  input inherited from the base directive is still an input on the component.

- **The horizontal label's grid column now survives being wrapped.** `_field.scss` placed
  it with `.hub-field--horizontal > .hub-field__label`, a direct child selector. The
  tooltip variant puts a row between the two, which would have taken the column away from
  every horizontal field in the library — the kind of breakage that surfaces as "the form
  looks wrong" three screens from the change. Both shapes are addressed now, and a spec
  holds them there.

## [22.30.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **`plaintext` on `hub-input` and `hub-textarea`: the value with no field around it.**
  The other half of `readonly`, and the difference is who the field is for. `readonly`
  still belongs to somebody filling a form in — it is a _state_ of an editable field, and
  a design system can give it a box: `--hub-input-readonly-bg`,
  `--hub-input-readonly-border-color`, `-color` and `-cursor` are there to be set.
  `plaintext` is for the value that is simply being _shown_: a record open for
  consultation, a figure the server settled, a field a plan has locked. It is not a state
  a theme can put a box back on — having none is what it is.

    Worth knowing before you reach for it: **at the shipped defaults `readonly` already
    draws no box** — both those token defaults are `transparent`, deliberately, since a
    read-only value is there to be read and loses only the chrome that promises you can type
    in it. Untouched, the two differ in the horizontal padding (12px against 0), the inline
    border width, the cursor, and the affordances below; set
    `--hub-input-readonly-bg` and `--hub-input-readonly-border-color` and read-only takes the
    boxed look Bootstrap's own `readonly` ships with, while `plaintext` stays flat. Verified
    end to end in a browser rather than assumed.

    Modelled on Bootstrap's `.form-control-plaintext`, deliberately — it is the shape
    every reader already knows, and it solves the hard part: the control stays a real
    `<input>`/`<textarea>`, so the `<label for>` still points at something labelable and
    the text stays selectable. A `<span>` would have broken both, silently: the field goes
    on looking right while the screen reader stops announcing what it is reading.

    The horizontal padding goes and the border turns transparent **without losing its
    width**, and the vertical padding moves rather than shrinks: none above, the field's
    whole vertical padding below. That buys both things at once. Nothing above puts the value
    directly under its label — the gap closes from 10px to 4px, because a label and its value
    are one thing and should read as a pair. Twice the padding below holds the total at
    exactly an editable field's height, measured at 38px against 38px, so a grid mixing the
    two still lines up. It is written as `calc(var(--hub-input-padding-y) * 2)` rather than a
    literal, so it cannot drift if that padding ever moves. `plaintext` implies `readonly`, so
    the two cannot be passed in disagreement, and the two presentations are exclusive —
    `hub-field--plaintext` never carries `hub-field--readonly`, which would put the box
    back.

    Every affordance goes with the box, because each one offers a choice the field is no
    longer making: the input's clear button, a projected select's caret and clear, a
    datepicker's icon, a textarea's drag handle — and its character counter, which tells
    you how much room is left to type and so promises typing. A `hub-textarea` with
    `[counter]` shown as plain text was still printing `12 / 200` under a field with no
    box; it no longer renders it.

    The value steps back a shade, through `--hub-input-plaintext-color`. Measured on the
    documentation site, label and value came out at exactly the same colour, separated by 2px
    of size and one weight step: enough inside a box, which does the separating, and not
    enough once the box is gone — a column of them read as undifferentiated lines. **The
    label is left exactly as it is on every other field**, on the same tokens and the same
    weight, because a form's labels have to keep one rhythm whatever state each field is in.
    It is the value that moves: `gray-700` against the editable `gray-900`, and one weight
    step lighter through `--hub-input-plaintext-font-weight`, so it stops competing with its
    own label. Enough to say it is not being edited, not enough to read as disabled — 8.18:1
    against the page, so it clears AAA. Verify the weight against your own font: `system-ui`
    has a light face and renders it 2.5px narrower over a 29-character string, but a family
    without one will synthesise or ignore it.

## [22.29.0] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **`hub-datepicker`: the panel is as wide as the day grid, and stays that width all
  year.** It used `width: max-content`, so it sized itself to whichever child was widest
  — and with the month spelled out that child was the header, not the calendar. Paging
  from «Mayo de 2026» to «Septiembre de 2026» grew the whole panel around a grid whose
  seven columns never moved: measured across twelve months in Spanish, 270px to 318px.
  The width is now arithmetic on the grid's own tokens — seven cells, the six gaps
  between them, and the panel's padding — and the header title is a flexible item that
  takes what the nav groups leave. Measured after: 268px flat, every month.

    The period grid already declared `min-width: cell-size * 7` with the note that «three
    wide cells read as the same block as seven narrow ones»; the panel simply never
    honoured it.

- **The header writes the month abbreviated by default** (`ago 2026`, not `agosto de
2026`). This is what makes the width above possible rather than merely stable: once the
  two nav groups have taken theirs, 104px are left for the title, and the longest Spanish
  month needs 152px spelled out. New input `[monthFormat]` takes it back to `'long'` for
  a consumer whose panel has room — the header's casing rules still apply to the phrase,
  particle and all.

- `--hub-datepicker-grid-gap` (default `0.125rem`) replaces the literal the day grid used,
  because the panel now measures itself with the same value and two literals drift.

- **The header now abbreviates the month by default**, which is a visible change on every datepicker and one the compiler cannot warn about. Announced in `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`, with the two-part migration: `[monthFormat]="'long'"` asks for the old form back, and the panel has to be widened at `:root` for it to fit.

## [22.28.0] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- **`<hub-datepicker>` no longer opens its calendar behind a modal.** The overlay the calendar lives in takes the dropdown layer (`--hub-overlay-zindex`, `--hub-sys-zindex-dropdown`, `1000`) and its backdrop `999` — both below `HubModal` (`--hub-sys-zindex-modal`, `1055`). A date field inside a dialog therefore opened a calendar nobody could see, and a backdrop under the dialog that swallowed no click, so the one gesture that dismisses it did nothing either. Measured in a real product: `1000` against `1055`, correct only once the application patched the token itself.

    The sibling control had already answered this: `hub-select` stacks its panel above the modal by default. The datepicker now does the same, and for the same reason — two controls of one package should not disagree about where a panel opened inside a dialog belongs.

    The layer is set by redefining the overlay's own token rather than by declaring `z-index`, because `OverlayRef` writes the z-index **inline** as `var(--hub-overlay-zindex, 1000)` and no stylesheet beats an inline declaration; feeding the variable is the way in, and it leaves the overlay's contract untouched. The rules are two classes deep so they win regardless of which stylesheet the application loads last.

### Added

- **`--hub-datepicker-overlay-zindex`** — the calendar's stacking hook, defaulting to `calc(var(--hub-sys-zindex-modal, 1055) + 5)`, the same layer `--hub-select-dropdown-zindex` takes. One token moves both surfaces: the backdrop follows one layer under the calendar, which is where it has to be — over the dialog so it catches the click, under the calendar so it does not cover it. It is read through its `var()` fallback and never declared, so setting it anywhere in the cascade wins without fighting a `:root` declaration.

## [22.27.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **`hub-input` can hold the mixed state.** A `checkbox` accepts `indeterminate`, which reflects the native DOM property — the only place that state exists — so a screen reader announces it as mixed. It is a `model`, because the reader is the one who resolves it: clicking a mixed checkbox picks a side, the browser drops the native state, and the component now clears the input and tells the caller instead of fighting the browser back on the next render. That is what a "select all" over a partially selected list needs, and it was the one thing our checkbox could not say. The `switch` format ignores it: a switch is on or off, and ARIA gives it no third state. The state is drawn as a dash through the new `--hub-check-input-indeterminate-bg` / `-border-color` / `-icon` tokens: without them the mixed box rendered empty, which is what "nothing selected" looks like — the opposite of what it means.

## [22.26.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **`hub-timepicker` carries an input group, like every other field that renders as a box with a value.** It arrived after the list of fields that could was written, and arrived without one: a bare control inside `hub-field__body`, with no `__group`, no `prepend` / `append` inputs and no `hubPrepend` / `hubAppend` slots. "From [09:00] to [18:00]" is the shape a time field is asked for most often, and it was the one shape it could not make.

    Both directions of the relationship, because a field that can only host or only be hosted is half a field:

    - **As a host**: text addons on either edge, projected content in either slot, and the control squared against whatever it is attached to. The addons are drawn from the same tokens as every other field's, so a time field in a form of them is not a different shade of grey.
    - **As projected content**: a timepicker put into somebody else's slot gives up its own border and radius, takes the seam on the side it is attached to, and keeps the group's own outer corner. Those rules named four field elements and now name five.

    Verified in a browser across the seven combinations — addon on each edge and both, a projected button, a projected field, and a timepicker projected into another field on each side — in both directions. The painted corners mirror correctly under RTL, which is the check that matters: the rules are logical, and the field beneath them declares its radius with a physical shorthand.

### Fixed

- **The append half of 22.25.1's corner fix had no test.** Its spec projected a **select** into the append slot, whose box is `.ng-select-container` — an element the flattening rule cannot reach, carrying neither `.hub-field__control` nor the group's own `__control` class. That case passes with the fix and without it: deleting the whole append half left the suite green while the corner measured `0px` in a browser instead of `6px`. A projected **input** is the case the rule can see, and it is pinned now.

## [22.25.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **A field projected into a slot lost its outer corners as well as its seam.** Attaching a number to the front of a select — `cada [1] [Mes]` — drew the number with all four corners square behind the group's own rounded edge. Measured in a browser: `0 0 0 0` on the projected input while the select beside it correctly kept `0 6px 6px 0`.

    Two rules were reaching the same element. The seam rule squares the corner the projected field shares with the control, which is right. The **corner flattening at the bottom of the sheet** is a descendant rule on purpose — the box that paints a field is not always a child of the group — and it reads `.hub-field__control` inside a group as "the control this group is built around". A projected field puts a second one of those inside the same scope, so it took the flattening meant for the main control too.

    The comment on that rule states the assumption this breaks: _"nothing else inside a group carries these classes"_. True until a slot could hold a field, which is what 22.13.1 onwards made possible.

    The outer corner is handed back where the seam is squared, rather than excluded where it is flattened: the exclusion needs a complex `:not()` and this says plainly which corner belongs to whom. Scoped to the element actually on the outside — `:first-child` on a prepend strip, `:last-child` on an append one — because a slot may hold two fields, and the second one's leading edge is a seam like any other.

    The `group-flattening` spec projected **buttons** only, which carry border and radius on the very element the slot selects, so the case that broke had no coverage. It now projects a whole field in both directions and asserts the cascade winner on each corner, which is what fails without the fix.

## [22.25.0] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- **`@angular/cdk` is no longer a peer dependency.** One component used it — the datepicker, for the overlay its calendar lives in — and every consumer of this package installed the CDK for it. The calendar now uses `ng-hub-ui-utils`' own overlay, which this package already depended on, so the install shrinks by a package for everybody.

    Not a like-for-like swap, because a like-for-like swap would have been a regression. Two things had to be built in `ng-hub-ui-utils@22.11.0` first, and both are worth knowing about:

    - **The overlay had no repositioning.** Coordinates were computed once and never again, so a panel opened and then scrolled sat where it was left. What makes it better than what it replaces is where the listener sits: on `window` in the **capture** phase. A `scroll` event on an element does not bubble, so the CDK's `document`-level listener never hears an application that scrolls an inner container rather than the page — and this repository's own docs site is exactly that shape, which is why its CDK-backed calendar drifted too. Measured after the swap: the panel holds its 4px offset and its start-edge alignment across repeated scrolls, in both directions.
    - **`start` and `end` were physical.** They resolved to `left` and `right` whatever the direction, which would have undone the RTL work of 22.24.0 the moment the calendar moved onto them. They are logical now, read from the origin element.

    A third thing was missing and only a browser found it: **Escape stopped closing the calendar.** The panel does not hold focus — opened from a click, the active element is the body — so the grid's own `keydown` never heard the key, while `cdkConnectedOverlay` had been closing on Escape from anywhere through the CDK's global keyboard dispatcher. `ng-hub-ui-utils` grew the same mechanism, and the datepicker wires Escape to it. Verified in a browser rather than assumed, which is how the regression was caught in the first place.

    Everything the datepicker asked the CDK for is preserved deliberately, offset included, so a visual difference means the swap is wrong rather than better. What is not preserved is the drift. Focus behaviour is unchanged: the panel never takes focus, and Escape leaves it on the field.

    Consumers keeping `@angular/cdk` for their own use are unaffected; those who installed it only for this package can drop it. `ng-hub-ui-utils` moves to `>=22.11.0`.

## [22.24.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **`hub-select` honours `labelType="floating"`.** It has accepted the input for as long as floating labels have existed and then ignored it: the template only ever branched on `Horizontal`, so a select asked to float rendered its label stacked above the field, exactly as if nothing had been passed. A form that floated its text fields and put a select among them came out with one label inside the box and the next one above it — and nothing anywhere said why, because an input that renders nothing looks precisely like an input you forgot to write.

    The label now sits inside the control and lifts on focus or on a value. Its geometry is **the same as `hub-input`'s, and now literally the same numbers**: three new tokens — `--hub-field-floating-inset`, `--hub-field-floating-travel` and `--hub-field-floating-scale` — hold the geometry, and every field that floats a label reads them. Two copies of the same three numbers is exactly how two fields stop being one: the select shipped with its own and came out with a bigger label, sitting lower, in a taller box.

    At rest the label **is the placeholder** — the field's own font size, the placeholder colour, centred in the box exactly as a placeholder is centred in its own. Measured against a plain field's placeholder: 16px against 16px, the same muted colour, and zero deviation from the centre in both. Taking `.hub-field__label`'s smaller size instead left it a shade under the placeholder of the plain field above it, which reads as two kinds of field in one form. It is also centred in the field rather than hung from the top by padding. Both alternatives were tried and both are worse: aligning it to the top by padding leaves the label and the value a different few pixels apart in each field, because their font sizes differ and so do their line boxes; sitting it on the value looks right in a filled field and wrong in an empty one, which is the state most of a form is in — the value rides low to leave room for the lifted label, so a label pinned to it left the top third of every empty box blank and the text stranded at the bottom. Centred, an empty field reads as a field, and the three fields that can float a label land on the same pixel.

    `--hub-field-floating-scale` is **3/4**, not the 0.85 the input used to hard-code. A placeholder shrunk by 0.85 is still nearly a placeholder up there, and the point of lifting it is that it stops being one; three quarters of 16px is the 12px Material floats to.

    Only the `dropdown` format floats: the deprecated `buttons` / `checkbox` / `radio` have no box to float into and keep their stacked label rather than losing it.

    Three details worth recording, because each looks like a decision and is really a constraint:

    - The lift is driven by classes on the group (`--floating`, `--raised`) rather than by the engine's own `ng-select-focused` / `ng-has-value`. The label is a **sibling** of the control, so reading the engine's state across that boundary would need `:has()` — and where `:has()` is unsupported that rule fails silently, which is the same invisible nothing this entry is fixing.
    - The label hangs off a zero-width anchor placed where the control starts, not off the group's leading edge — a group can open with a `prepend` addon or an attached button, and a label pinned to the group would print on top of it — and that anchor is raised above the control, because the engine draws its box on `.ng-select-container`, which is `position: relative` by its own rule and comes later in the DOM, so at the same layer it paints last and the label simply disappeared under an opaque background. How far above is the bullet below.
    - The whole block sits **after** the engine theme in the stylesheet. Several of its rules tie on specificity with the theme's own (`.ng-select-multiple .ng-value-container` zeroes the very padding the floating layout adds), and a tie is settled by source order: read first, the label worked on a single select and sat on top of the chips of a multiple one.

    A placeholder set alongside a floating label is shown only once the label has lifted, which is the only moment it has anything left to say — until then the label is standing in the placeholder's place, which is what floating a label means.

- **`hub-datepicker` honours `labelType="floating"` too.** It had the same silent gap the select did — the template branched only on `Horizontal`, so a datepicker asked to float its label stacked it instead — and it went unnoticed for the same reason: an input that renders nothing looks exactly like an input you forgot to pass. It reads the same three `--hub-field-floating-*` tokens, so the three fields that can float a label are one field rather than three that resemble each other.

    Driven by a class rather than by `:focus` / `:placeholder-shown`, which is how the input does it. The calendar is an overlay: opening it takes focus out of the input, so a rule keyed on the pseudo-class would drop the label back over the value at the one moment the reader is using the field. The open panel therefore counts as raised alongside focus and a value, and that is pinned by a test rather than left to be rediscovered.

    A placeholder set alongside it waits for the label to lift, as it does on the select — until then the label is standing in the placeholder's place.

- **The floating label no longer goes out while the panel is open.** The engine lifts `.ng-select-container` to `z-index: 1001` for as long as the dropdown is up (its own rule, in vendored source that is re-synced from upstream and so cannot be edited on this side), and that opaque white box painted straight over the label — which vanished for exactly the moment you were choosing an option, the one moment you are looking at the field. The label's anchor now sits at `1002`. It carries no pointer events, so nothing about operating the control changes.

- **The whole library is RTL-correct.** Physical properties were converted to logical ones across the field primitives — 38 declarations in `datepicker` (13), `select` (11), `input` (10), `slider` (3) and `textarea` (1): paddings, margins, borders, corner radii, the icon gutter and the switch's travel. In a mirrored form the datepicker's calendar button now opens the field on the correct side, an attached addon keeps its flattened corners against the control, and a right-aligned counter aligns to the reader's end rather than to a fixed edge.

    Three components could not be converted by substitution, because their geometry is only half CSS. Each was measured in a browser in both directions rather than reasoned about:

    - **The slider.** A native `<input type="range">` genuinely mirrors under RTL — clicking a quarter of the way along the track yields 76, not 24 — but the filled portion of the track is a background image, and background positions answer to nothing. The fill grew from the left while the thumb ran from the right. The fill now starts at the opposite edge under RTL, and the same mirroring is applied to the band of a dual-thumb rail. The value bubble moved to `inset-inline-start`, which mirrors on its own; the `translateX` that keeps it from hanging out of the component has no logical form, so its sign is flipped explicitly — getting that wrong re-creates the exact overflow it was written to prevent, only at the other end, which is why it is now pinned by a test.
    - **The switch.** Its knob travelled on `left`, along with a `transition` naming that property. Both moved to `inset-inline-start` together — naming the physical property in the transition while the inset is logical animates nothing at all. Measured: the knob runs 2px→18px in LTR and 18px→2px in RTL, and is halfway across at 70ms in both, so it still animates rather than jumps.
    - **The segmented control.** Its CSS needed no change: the indicator is placed from a measured `offsetLeft`, which is physical in both directions and therefore already agrees with the `left` it is written into. What was missing is that nothing re-measures when direction changes — a flip re-lays the options out without resizing anything, so the `ResizeObserver` that normally keeps the pill honest never fires. Measured on a live page, the pill was left up to 145px from the option it marked, and stayed there until the next click. It now watches `dir` across the document — the root included, but any container too, because an RTL island inside an LTR page is an ordinary thing to build and is the only shape a docs example can show — and re-measures. After the fix, every bar on the page is within a pixel of its option in both directions, and stays there when the direction is flipped under it.

### Fixed

- **The floating label's RTL rule was dead code.** It was written as `:host-context([dir='rtl'])`, and both components use `ViewEncapsulation.None` — so Angular never runs the shim that translates that selector and it shipped verbatim to the bundle, where it matches nothing. The label anchored to the correct edge and then shrank toward the wrong one. It is now an ordinary `[dir='rtl']` descendant rule, which is also what the vendored select engine's own RTL mixin emits. Worth recording that the earlier measurement had already reported the tell — a `transform-origin` of `0 0` under RTL — and it was read past.

- **Spec files are no longer published.** The package's asset glob copied everything under `src/lib/styles`, which swept two `.spec.ts` files — 25.8kB of test code — into every consumer's `node_modules`. The glob is now limited to the stylesheets that folder exists to ship.

### Changed

- **`--hub-select-min-height` is derived rather than declared.** It was `2.5rem`, a number that had drifted from the arithmetic every other field arrives at — one line of text between two paddings and two borders, which is 38px at the default scale. The select therefore stood **2px taller than an input or a datepicker**, with or without a floating label, and an input attached to a select in the same group was stretched to 40px to match it. The token now spells out that arithmetic, so input, select and datepicker all measure 38px plainly and 56px with a floating label. A consumer who sets the token themselves is unaffected; one who relied on the 2.5rem default gets a 2px shorter select — see `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

- **A floating field is taller.** `--hub-field-floating-inset` is `1.125rem`, where the previous hard-coded value was `0.625rem`, so a floating `hub-input` goes from 46px to 56px — and a floating `hub-select`, which used to sit 2px taller than everything around it, lands on the same 56px (see below). The old spacing left the lifted label about 6px from the top border and all but touching the value underneath: legible in a screenshot, cramped on a screen. The new one leaves ~10px above the label and ~5px between label and value, which is where Material's own 56px field lands. Every screen with floating labels grows by that amount — in practice the login, register and password screens.

## [22.23.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **A form that sets `--hub-field-stack-gap` is obeyed again.** 22.23.1 declared the token's default in `:root`. Two `:root` declarations tie on specificity, so the winner is whichever stylesheet the application happens to import last — and an application whose own token file came first had its `1rem` silently overruled, leaving every stacked field touching.

    The default now lives where it is read, as the fallback of `var(--hub-field-stack-gap, 0)`. A fallback competes with nobody: declare the token and it wins, declare nothing and the field leaves no gap, whatever the import order.

    Verified against the reported shape rather than a convenient one — a consumer sheet inserted **before** the library's, where the old code failed: `0px` with nothing declared, `16px` with the consumer asking for `1rem`.

## [22.23.1] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **`--hub-field-stack-gap`**, the space a field leaves under itself when fields are stacked. Zero by default — the gap between fields has always been the container's to give, through its own `gap` or margins — so no existing form moves. What it buys is that a form can hand that job to the fields, and that a control built into somebody else's chrome can be excluded from it.

### Fixed

- **A control `hubFormControlAdapter` creates is no longer part of a stack.** The adapter zeroes the token on every host it builds, so a field created into another component's chrome — a table's search group, a paginator's row — never reserves room below itself and cannot make the group taller than the field it holds.

    Worth recording how this arrived: the zeroing shipped first on its own, writing a token that no rule read. It was inert, and measurable as such — raising the token to `20px` on a live field left the margin at `0px` in a form and in a table alike. The write is only a fix now that the token is declared and the host reads it.

### Fixed

- **A control `hubFormControlAdapter` creates no longer keeps a form field's stacking margin.** Field hosts carry `margin-bottom: var(--hub-field-stack-gap)` so that fields written one under another in a form breathe. A control created _into another component's chrome_ — a table's search group, a paginator's row — is in no such list and never was, and the gap it kept made the group taller than the field: anything stretching beside it came out taller too. A table's search button overshot its own field by exactly that margin, 54px against 38px, and the two stopped reading as one control.

    The adapter is the only place that knows a control is being embedded, so it says it there: the token is zeroed on the host as the component is created. Every library that wires the adapter gets it, rather than each one discovering the same margin separately and patching it from outside — which is what happened first, twice, in the wrong places: a `::ng-deep` rule in the host library, then a block in the consuming application.

    Written on the element rather than through a stylesheet on purpose. A rule would have to name the control from outside, which is exactly what emulated encapsulation forbids and what sent the first attempt reaching for `::ng-deep`.

## [22.23.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **`<hub-timepicker>`, a time of day.** The family had a date and no hour, so a product that needed one reached for a text field with an `HH:MM` pattern. A pattern is the wrong tool three times over: no numeric keyboard on a phone, nothing offered when the field is focused, and `8:00` accepted until the form is submitted rather than refused while it is typed. Built on the platform's `<input type="time">`, so the keyboard, the stepper and the reader's own 12- or 24-hour presentation come for free — and what it publishes is normalised to `HH:MM`, so what a form holds does not change with the locale it is read in. An empty field publishes `null` and not the empty string, because "no time" is an absence and a string of length zero sails past a `required` written as a null check. Takes `min`, `max` and `step` (in seconds: 900 offers quarter hours), and reads a value that carries more than the hour — `09:30:00`, a whole instant — rather than showing nothing, which is what the native control does with anything it cannot parse.

## [22.22.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`searchFn` reaches the engine.** The underlying select has always taken one; this wrapper never passed it on, so a consumer who wanted typing to match on something the option shows and the label does not — the building a room is in, the code beside a name — had to smuggle it into `bindLabel` and hide it again behind a label template.

### Fixed

- **An `addTag` that resolves with nothing no longer adds anything.** The synchronous branch has always guarded that; the promise branch did not, so a creation dialog the user dismissed, or a request the server refused, became an option built out of `null`, pushed into the list and written into the form. The caller said no and the field answered with a record that does not exist. Nobody meets this by hand — you have to cancel the dialog to see it — so it now has a case of its own.

## [22.21.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **The seam of a group can be undone.** Attached content is welded to the control and to its neighbours: shared corners flat, no space between, one border shared. That is right while the strip has to read as a single line, and wrong the moment the field is not drawn as a box — inside a table cell, where each control and each action stands on its own.

    Four tokens govern it, and their defaults are exactly today's behaviour, so nothing moves for anyone who says nothing:

    | Token                                     | Default                         | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `--hub-input-group-attached-radius`       | `0`                             | The corners a group shares — the control's _and_ the strip's. Set it to the field radius and nothing carries the flat side that says "joined" |
    | `--hub-input-group-attached-gap`          | `0`                             | Space between the elements a slot projects                                                                                                    |
    | `--hub-input-group-attached-border-width` | `var(--hub-input-border-width)` | The attached border, no longer the field's own                                                                                                |
    | `--hub-input-group-attached-border-color` | `var(--hub-input-border-color)` | Its colour                                                                                                                                    |

    The last two exist because sharing one variable held only while both were drawn: zeroing the field's border erased the border of every button beside it too, and an outline button — whose entire shape is that line — collapsed into a bare glyph. Point the colour at `currentColor` and each action keeps its own, so a destructive one stays red instead of being repainted the field's grey.

    Governable from an **ancestor**, not through an input on each of four primitives: the tokens are declared at `:root` and never redeclared on a component host, so a `<td>`, a toolbar or a panel sets them and every field inside obeys — including whatever a consumer projects into a template the library cannot see into. That is the same reason `ng-hub-ui-paginable`'s new `flushFields` needs no cooperation from any field.

## [22.20.1] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **The two attach slots document that they take a field, not only an action.** `hubPrepend` and `hubAppend` gained the capability in 22.20.0 and said nothing about it, which is the same as not having it: a consumer reaching for the slot had no reason to believe a `<hub-select>` would close flush against the host field rather than sit beside it.

    The JSDoc now states the shape and, more usefully, its two limits — only `hub-input`, `hub-select`, `hub-textarea` and `hub-datepicker`, and only as a **direct child** of the template. Wrapping one in a `<div>` falls back to the treatment an action gets, silently, because the rules select direct children. Both READMEs carry the same.

## [22.20.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`hubPrepend` / `hubAppend` can now attach a FIELD, not only a button.** A `<hub-select>` projected into a slot kept its own rounded leading corners and sat a padding-width away from the control, so the two read as a field and a loose control parked beside it — the opposite of attaching them.

    The slot's rules assumed they could reach the box they were squaring. That holds for a button, an anchor or a bare span, whose border and radius sit on the very element the slot selects. A field primitive holds neither on its host: the host is a plain custom element and the box lives on the control inside it. So the slot painted a second border around a control that already had one, squared corners nobody can see, and left the visible leading edge untouched.

    The treatment is forwarded one level down now — the host gives up the border and padding it should never have taken, and the control inside takes the squaring. Measured in a browser, on a `<hub-select>` appended to a `<hub-input>`:

    |                               | before | after |
    | ----------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
    | leading radius of the control | 6px    | 0px   |
    | border on the host            | 1px    | 0px   |
    | padding on the host           | 12px   | 0px   |

    The trailing radius stays at 6px — the outer corner still belongs to whatever is on the outside — and the overlap with the field is one border width, so the pair draws as a single line.

    The case is ordinary, not a curiosity: a price and the period it is a price of are one statement, and splitting "180 € a month" across two separate fields makes the reader reassemble it on every row. Both slots are covered, not just `append`.

## [22.19.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **The package shipped without its licence notice.** `package.json` declared MIT, but no `LICENSE` file travelled in the tarball — and MIT itself requires the copyright notice to be included in distributions. The notice ships now.

## [22.19.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **A range picker no longer commits a range that has only one end.** The first click used to be published immediately as `{ start, end: null }`, which cost twice: opening a picker that already held a complete span and clicking a new start destroyed the old value before the user had chosen anything, and dismissing the panel there left the control holding a half-open shape that every consumer then has to defend against.

    The first pick is now a question, not an answer. It is drawn on the grid and previewed as the pointer sweeps, but nothing reaches the control until the second end lands; dismissing the panel half-way rolls the panel back to the value that was last committed, so the field and the model never disagree. Clearing is unaffected — an explicit clear still publishes `null`.

    `day-time-range` was never affected: picking the day settles both ends at once.

    Released as a minor rather than a patch because what the control receives has changed: an application that leaned on the half-open emission to drive its own "now pick the end" affordance should listen to the panel instead.

## [22.18.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **A number field with no bounds wrote `min="null"` and `max="null"`.** `[min]` is a property binding and the IDL property stringifies whatever it is handed, so an unset input reached the DOM as the literal string. Browsers cannot parse it and constraint validation ignores it — which is exactly why it survived, since typing was never affected — but assistive technology reads the attributes as present and announces `valuemin=0 valuemax=0`. A screen-reader user was told that a price field accepting any amount had to be zero. Bound through `[attr.min]` / `[attr.max]` now, which removes the attribute instead of writing `null` into it.

- **A button projected into `hubAppend` or `hubPrepend` ignored its own `variant` and `color`.** The slot doubles its class to beat chrome arriving from another package, and that weight was also swallowing what the consumer asked for: a `hubButton` declaring `variant="outline" color="neutral"` came out in the library's action colour, so the directive accepted two inputs and discarded them without a word. The fill is wrapped in `:where()` now — a default rather than a verdict. A bare `<span>` still gets a surface to sit on; anything that styles itself outranks it.

- **The border of an attached action vanished under the pointer.** Attached actions overlap by a border width so a run reads as one line, which leaves the shared pixel to whichever paints last — the one further right, always. Hovering the left button darkened everything except the edge it shares with its neighbour, and a border that goes missing under the pointer reads as a rendering fault rather than as a hover state. The action under the pointer or the focus ring is raised above its neighbour, and only then: raising it permanently would stop DOM order drawing the run as one line at rest.

## [22.18.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **`<hub-datepicker mode="day-time-range">` — one day, two times within it.** Booking a room, a slot or a shift is not two free instants; it is the day, from 09:00 to 11:00. `range` could not say that: its two ends are free to land on different days, so products needing this had to bolt a validator on top and reject the impossible span after the user had already expressed it.

    The value is still a `HubDateRange`, so serialization, `min`/`max` and `valueFormat` are untouched and existing back ends that take a span need no change. What the mode adds is the guarantee that both ends share a calendar day — enforced by a control that cannot express anything else, rather than by a check that runs afterwards. A single click on the day settles the whole span, the two time strips carry the rest, and the input names the day once: "20/06/2026, 09:00 – 11:00".

    The mode implies a time, so a granularity coarser than `hour` is raised to it rather than rendering two time strips that cannot exist. A stored span that crosses midnight is pulled onto the start's day, keeping the time it asked for.

    Rejected on the way: fencing `range` with `min`/`max` driven from the chosen start. Those bound the **whole** picker, so once a start was chosen the user was locked out of every other day and could not move the start without clearing the field — trading a wrong selection for an inescapable one.

- **`<hub-datepicker mode="range">` now previews the half it is still waiting for.** Between the two picks the range is half-open, and the grid said nothing about it: the anchor was lit, every other cell was inert, and the days the range was about to swallow gave no sign as the pointer swept over them. The band the range would take is now drawn against the cell under the cursor — or the one keyboard navigation last moved to, so arrowing towards the end date shows the same thing.

    Painted with a new `--hub-daterangepicker-preview-bg`, half the tint of the committed band and derived from it rather than from the accent, so retinting the range moves the preview with it. Tentative on purpose: reading as settled would make choosing the end feel like it had already happened.

    Works in both directions — picking the later day first and sweeping back is as ordinary as the other way round — and a disabled day under the cursor is skipped rather than dropping the band, so sweeping across a blocked date does not make it flicker.

### Fixed

- **A slot that projects two elements drew a rounded corner in the middle of the strip.** `hubAppend` and `hubPrepend` take a template, so a field can attach two buttons as easily as one — and the pair has to read as one piece, the way a run of string addons already does. Measured with two buttons on a `<hub-select>`: the control closed correctly at `6 0 0 6`, but the first button stayed at `0 6 6 0` instead of squaring off against the second.

    The rule that flattens a run of addons tests position among the group's **children** (`> .hub-…__addon--append:not(:last-child)`), and everything a slot projects lands inside a single `.hub-…__attached` wrapper — so it never saw them. The strip's own rules only squared the edge it shares with the control. Each side now hands its inner corners over as well, leaving the radius to whichever element is actually outermost, and both sides are written out rather than derived: the surviving corner is the leading one on a prepend strip and the trailing one on an append strip, and that asymmetry has been shipped backwards before.

    Fixed for all four families the mixin covers — input, select, datepicker and textarea — not just the one it was reported on.

- **The control repainted the edge it shares with attached content.** Whatever a slot projects is pulled onto the field's border by a negative inline margin, so the two borders land in the same pixel column and paint order decides which one you see. The select's container is `position: relative` — the engine's own rule — and the slot was static, so the control painted last and swallowed the attached border.

    It stayed hidden because both borders share a colour by default: the wrong element had been winning from the start, and it only surfaced once a consumer themed a projected button differently from the field. The slot is now positioned, with no `z-index` — joining the positioned layer is the whole fix, and a stacking context there would lift the slot over chrome that has nothing to do with this seam.

- **The datepicker capitalized the panel header wrong outside English.** `Intl` renders the month and year as "agosto de 2026", and `text-transform: capitalize` raised every word of it: "Agosto De 2026". Spanish does not capitalize the particle, and no consumer could undo it — component styles are injected after the global sheet, so an override had to out-specify rather than out-order them. The header now raises only its initial.

    The weekday and period labels deliberately keep word casing. Both render a single `Intl` token ("lun", "ago"), where the two rules mean the same thing, and both are `inline-flex` boxes — which `::first-letter` does not apply to, so converting them would have dropped their capital altogether. Verified in a browser: the header title is a flex item, and flex items are blockified, which is what makes the rule land there and nowhere else.

## [22.17.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Every `<hub-select>` with an addon shipped 22.17.0 with both corners still round**, so the field drew as separate boxes parked together. A regression introduced by the previous release: widening the flattening selector to reach the datepicker's nested input trimmed the select's branch from `.hub-select__control.ng-select .ng-select-container` to a bare `.ng-select-container`, taking it from four classes to two — under the three the select theme spends on that same corner, from a stylesheet that loads later.

    The branch is spelled out to the engine's class again, keeping the descendant combinator that the datepicker needs. Reaching an element and winning it are different things, and only the second one paints.

    **The test written for the previous release did not catch it**, which is the more useful part. It asked whether the shipped selector matched the painted element — `matches()` answered yes, the cascade answered no, and the suite stayed green through a defect visible on the docs site. It now resolves every rule that claims the corner, ranks them by specificity and source order, and asserts ours is the one that wins. Restoring the 22.17.0 selector fails it on both sides of the select.

## [22.17.0] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- **The fill moved from the labels to the actions, and every field with an addon changes appearance.** A static `prepend` / `append` used to be a grey box beside the control; it now shares the field's own surface, so the group reads as one box with a unit written inside it. What can be operated — a projected button, a link, anything focusable — carries the fill instead.

    The fill is the affordance, and it was on the wrong thing. A grey box holding a glyph reads as a button whatever the glyph means: attaching a decorative icon produced something indistinguishable from the real actions beside it, while those actions sat transparent and read as inert. Reported from the docs site as "the pencil doesn't work", which is the right complaint about an icon that looks pressable and is not.

    Two tokens carry it, wired to the design system's semantic palette rather than to a fixed grey, so it follows a themed build: `--hub-<field>-group-action-bg` (default `--hub-sys-color-secondary-subtle`) and `--hub-<field>-group-action-color`. `--hub-<field>-group-addon-bg` now defaults to the field's own background; setting it back to `--hub-sys-surface-elevated` restores the previous look on a field, or on all of them through `--hub-input-group-addon-bg`.

    A projected control that brings its own background still wins — a `.btn-primary` stays blue.

### Fixed

- **`<hub-datepicker>` kept its input fully rounded between an addon and an attached action**, drawing three separate boxes where the other fields draw one. The flattening rule used a child combinator, and this field's input is a grandchild of the group: it sits inside the `__trigger` that serves as the overlay origin. The rule read as though it covered every field while matching nothing on the nested ones.

    This is 22.13.1 one storey lower — the same defect for the same reason, a selector that matches nothing raising no error. It also survived the release measurement, because that read the radii off the `__trigger` wrapper, which paints no box at all, instead of the input inside it that does. The rule is now descendant-scoped, so it reaches the control wherever the field chooses to nest it.

- **Content attached with `[hubPrepend]` / `[hubAppend]` collapsed to the width of its glyph unless it arrived pre-styled.** A `.btn` brings its own inline padding and its line-height centres what it holds; a bare `<span>` around an icon brings neither, so it rendered as an 18px sliver with the icon pinned to the top edge — a whole row away from centre in a textarea.

    Attached content now takes the field's inline padding and centres what it holds, which is what the string addons have always done. Nothing that already looked right moves: the padding is the value `.btn` was already using.

    All of it is pinned by tests that ask the DOM whether the element matches the selectors this library actually ships, rather than measuring — `matches()` needs no `var()` resolution, so jsdom can answer it, and the assertion survives the selector being rewritten. Writing that test is also what caught the exclusion list being spelled `:not(:is(…))`, which is Selectors 4 and silently matches nothing on engines that only implement the chained form.

## [22.16.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **`<hub-select>` ignored a placeholder set globally in `NgSelectConfig`.** The last of the three inputs that overwrote the app's configuration with a value of this component's own — here an empty string, which is every bit as present as a sentence and just as effective at winning a `??`.

    Nothing changes for an app that does not configure one: `NgSelectConfig.placeholder` carries no default, so a select with no placeholder anywhere still renders none. The fallback now lives in this component rather than in the engine's template — the vendored source is re-synced from upstream, and a fallback that lives there is one sync away from disappearing.

    `fixedPlaceholder` and `appendTo` also differ from the engine's configured defaults and are **left alone**: both are deliberate, both say so in their JSDoc, and `fixedPlaceholder` in particular would change how every select in every app renders a selected value. A test now pins that decision so the next pass at this does not sweep it up with the genuine defects.

## [22.16.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **`[hubPrepend]` / `[hubAppend]` attach an icon or a button to a field's edge** — anything richer than the text a `prepend` / `append` string can carry. A search box with a pulsable magnifier, an amount with a "calculate", a token with a "copy".

    Available on every field that renders as a box with a value: `<hub-input>`, `<hub-select>`, `<hub-textarea>` and `<hub-datepicker>`. The other four fields are deliberately left out — a slider is a rail, a segmented control is already a row of buttons, a file input is a dropzone and an OTP is a run of separate boxes, and "attached to the edge" would have to be invented for each.

    They **compose** with the string addons rather than replacing them. The strings render first, so projected content is always the outermost element on its side: a unit labels the field, the action sits beyond it — the same order `hub-input` already used for its password toggle.

    Declared as templates because a field's `<ng-content>` is already spoken for: the select's carries `<ng-option>` through to its engine, the input projects its in-field affixes. Rendering from a template also fixes the DOM order, so tabbing reaches the field before the button acting on it.

- **`<hub-textarea>` and `<hub-datepicker>` gain `prepend` / `append` group addons**, the contract `hub-input` and `hub-select` already had. No new tokens were needed: the shared structure falls back to the input's `--hub-input-*` tokens, so a field only declares its own when it wants to differ — and a consumer can still theme one field alone by setting `--hub-textarea-group-addon-bg` and friends.

### Changed

- **The group and addon structure of all four fields now comes from one shared SCSS mixin** (`styles/_group-addons.scss`) instead of a copy each. The input and the select had already drifted apart — the input on physical properties (`border-right`, shorthand radii) and adjacent-sibling selectors, the select on logical properties and positional ones — which is the divergence that produced both of the seam bugs this library has shipped.

    Both lessons are now written into the single place that can prevent them: the corner flattening hangs off classes on the group and never off sibling combinators (22.13.1, where the input's rules never once matched because an affix span always sat in between), and projected content wears the field's chrome rather than its own (22.15.1). The input gains correct RTL behaviour as a side effect.

    Attached content is marked `hub-<field>__attached`. The input keeps `__affix` for the glyphs it positions _inside_ the box — that is a different thing and now has a different word.

### Deprecated

- **`[hubSelectSuffix]`** — use `[hubAppend]`, which does the same on every field that takes one rather than only on the select. Shipped in 22.15.0 and superseded one release later: generalising the slot left the select with two names for one concept, and retiring the narrower one a day after it shipped costs less than documenting the difference forever. It keeps working and renders through the same slot; `[hubAppend]` wins if both are present.

### Fixed

- **`<hub-select>` rendered "No items found" and "Add item" in English no matter what the app configured.** `NgSelectConfig` is the one place an app translates the dropdown's own strings, and the engine reads it as a fallback (`notFoundText() ?? config.notFoundText`). A fallback only fires on a missing value — and this component handed down its own default of `'No items found'`, a perfectly good string, so the config was unreachable from every select in the app.

    Both inputs now default to undefined and the fallback does its job. An explicit `notFoundText` / `addTagText` still wins, so the handful of call sites that were passing the text by hand to work around this keep working and can drop it.

    Reported downstream, where the tell was that "type to search" _did_ translate: that string is not forwarded at all, so nothing overwrote it.

- **A `<hub-select>` carrying only an attached action kept its trailing corner rounded under it.** The select marked that case with `--has-suffix` while the shared flattening rule keys off `--has-append`, which it set from the string addons alone — so a select with a button and no `append=""` never squared the corner the button sits against. The other three fields already read both sources; the select now does too, and `--has-suffix` is gone rather than left as a second name for the same state.

    It survived the test suite because the assertion paired an action _with_ a string addon, where the string set the flag on its own and the action's contribution was never actually observed. The regression test drops the string and asserts the action alone.

## [22.15.1] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **An action attached with `[hubSelectSuffix]` did not wear the field's chrome.** 22.15.0 shipped it looking like two boxes stuck together: the seam was the action's own 1.5px dark border against the field's 1px light one, and the action stood about seven pixels taller than the control it is attached to.

    The cause is that what gets projected brings chrome from its own package — `hubButton` sets a border width, a radius and vertical padding — through a single-class rule in a stylesheet that loads _after_ this one. A single class here ties on specificity and loses on order, so every declaration meant to normalise the action was silently overridden.

    The rule now doubles its own class to outrank that, and the action takes the field's border, the field's radii and the field's height: its vertical padding is surrendered to the group and it stretches into the row instead of setting its own height. Inline padding stays, so a projected icon keeps its breathing room.

    A regression test asserts the shipped rule rather than the rendered pixels — jsdom loads the stylesheet but resolves neither `var()` nor logical properties like `padding-block`, so measuring there would report an unstyled page and pass whatever it was handed. It catches the rule being weakened, which is exactly what shipped; the pixels are checked in a browser before release.

    Worth naming why the existing tests stayed green through it: they assert that the action renders, that it stays out of the dropdown engine and that it follows the control in the DOM. All three were true the whole time. Nothing asserted anything about how it looked.

## [22.15.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **`<hub-select>` takes `prepend` and `append` group addons**, the same contract `hub-input` has had all along. A currency, a unit, a protocol: a string is one addon, an array is a run of them, and empty entries are dropped rather than drawn as an empty box. The field and its addons share one border and round only their outer corners, so `prepend="€" append="/ month"` reads as one control instead of three boxes parked together.

    Three tokens, chained to the input's so the same addon looks the same whichever field carries it, and still overridable on their own: `--hub-select-group-addon-bg`, `--hub-select-group-addon-color`, `--hub-select-group-addon-border-color`.

    The corner flattening is driven by `hub-select__group--has-prepend` / `--has-append` on the group rather than by adjacent-sibling selectors. That is the lesson 22.14.0 paid for on the input, where the equivalent rules hung off `+`, never once matched because an affix span always sat in between, and cost nothing to be wrong — a selector that matches nothing raises no error.

- **`[hubSelectSuffix]` attaches an interactive control to the select's inline-end edge** — a button acting on whatever is selected: configure it, look it up, create a new one.

    Deliberately not the same slot as an addon. An addon is a static label sharing the field's border; this is focusable and sits outside the box, so it never competes for the corner the dropdown arrow and the clear cross already share, where a click landing on the wrong one of three opens a panel when somebody meant to open a dialog.

    It is a `<ng-template>` rather than projected content because the select's catch-all `<ng-content>` carries `<ng-option>` through to the engine and is declared first, so anything projected plainly would land inside the dropdown. Rendering from a template also keeps the action after the control in the DOM, so tabbing reaches the field before the button that acts on it.

    Both mechanisms compose: with an append addon and an action present, the action is always the outermost element — the same order `hub-input` uses for its password toggle.

## [22.14.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **`<hub-datepicker>` can pick a time, and a granularity anywhere from a year to a second.** The picker only ever yielded calendar days, so a validity window with an hour — a building access code valid "today from 9 to 21" — had to be rounded up to a whole day. A single-use code for a courier ended up opening the door around the clock. The remaining option was hand-rolling a control around `<input type="datetime-local">`, which is the thing this library exists to avoid.

    The new `granularity` input takes `'year' | 'month' | 'day' | 'hour' | 'minute' | 'second'` and also selects the panel: `year` and `month` render a 12-cell period grid, `day` the calendar as before, and anything finer adds a time strip beneath it. It is orthogonal to `mode` — `mode` says how many points are picked, `granularity` how precise each one is — so `mode="range" granularity="month"` yields `{ start: "2026-01", end: "2026-06" }`, and both endpoints of a time range carry their own hour.

    **The default is `'day'`, which emits the same bare `YYYY-MM-DD` string it always has.** Nothing that exists today changes behaviour; a named block of tests states that guarantee explicitly rather than leaving it to inspection.

    From `hour` onwards the value is a full ISO 8601 timestamp carrying **the reader's local wall clock and the offset of that very date** — `2026-09-01T09:00:00+02:00` in Madrid in September, `+01:00` for the same clock in January. Local-with-offset over UTC on purpose: every calculation in the component already happens in the reader's zone by date parts, so this is the honest serialization of what was computed rather than a conversion the value no longer shows. It still denotes an unambiguous instant, and a consumer who wants UTC converts losslessly with `new Date(value).toISOString()`.

- **Three format axes, where before only display was configurable.** The value format was hardcoded inside `formatISO()` and the input format inside `parseDate()`, so a form model that had to hold `Date` objects, or an API that sent epoch millis, meant translating on both sides of the control.

    `valueFormat` says what the bound control holds — `'iso'` (default), `'date'` for a native `Date`, `'timestamp'` for epoch milliseconds, or a function for anything else. `parse` says how an incoming value is read, overriding the built-in detection of ISO strings of any width, `Date` instances and epoch milliseconds, and it applies to `min` and `max` too. `displayFormat` keeps its current meaning and now additionally accepts an Angular pattern such as `'dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm'` or a formatting function.

    The asymmetry is deliberate. A pattern _parser_ would mean writing a locale-aware date parser inside a library that advertises having no date dependency, and `01/02/2026` is two different days depending on who reads it. Formatting is cheap — `formatDate()` from `@angular/common` is already a dependency — so patterns are offered where they are free and refused where they would cost a parser.

- **`minuteStep`, `secondStep`, `hourFormat` and `timeDisplayFormat`**, each with a global default in `provideHubForms`. `hourFormat` is derived from the locale unless forced, and it governs the field's own display as well as the panel — otherwise a picker set to a 24-hour clock would show `14:30` in the panel and `02:30 PM` in the input, the same value contradicting itself.

- **The display is fitted to the granularity.** The default `displayFormat` names a day, so a month picker emitting `2026-09` would otherwise read `09/01/2026` in the field — showing a day nobody chose. `Intl` options now gain the time parts once a time is carried and lose the parts finer than the unit when it is coarser than a day (`2026` for a year, `09/2026` for a month). An explicit pattern string or function is never touched: the caller said exactly what they wanted.

- **New translatable labels** in `HubDatepickerLabels`: `done`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `meridiem`, `time`, `startTime` and `endTime`. AM/PM comes from `Intl`, like month and weekday names, so it needs no entry.

### Changed

- **`min` and `max` now honour the time, not just the day.** A day is disabled only when no instant of it is allowed, so `min = 2026-09-01T14:00` leaves 1 September clickable and the time controls refuse the earlier hours. A step that would leave the bounds is refused rather than clamped: clamping a held-down arrow key pins the value to the bound and reads as the control being stuck. At `day` granularity the comparison stays day-level, exactly as before.

- **Range endpoints are ordered by instant rather than by day.** The trap was never the range that crosses midnight — day-level ordering already handled `1 Sep 22:00 → 2 Sep 06:00`. It was the second click landing on the _same_ day: `compareDay()` returned 0 and the endpoints were left in click order, producing an end before its start. Picking 21:00 and then 09:00 on one day now reorders itself.

- **A time-carrying granularity keeps the panel open on select**, since closing on the day click would strand time controls the user has not reached yet. `closeOnSelect` is honoured at `day` and coarser; finer than that, a **Done** action appears in the footer. `Escape` and a backdrop click close as always.

- **`HubDateRange` and `HubDateValue` take an optional type parameter defaulting to `string`.** Every existing annotation keeps compiling and keeps meaning what it meant; consumers using `valueFormat="date"` write `HubDateValue<Date>`.

### Fixed

- **An input with `prepend` or `append` drew two boxes instead of one field.** The control kept its four rounded corners and the addon drew its own rounded box right against it, so `<hub-input append="€">` read as a field with a separate pill parked behind it rather than as an amount with its unit. The rules meant to flatten the joining corners were already written and had never once matched: both hung off the adjacent-sibling combinator, and the prefix and suffix affix spans are rendered unconditionally — an addon is never the control's adjacent sibling, so `+` reached an affix and stopped. Silent, because a selector that matches nothing costs nothing.
  The flattening is now driven by `hub-input__group--has-prepend` / `hub-input__group--has-append` on the group, the same shape the password toggle already used for the same job, so it no longer depends on what happens to sit between the addon and the control. Both sides are covered, including a field with an addon at each end, and the password toggle still keeps the end corner when it is present.
  A run of several addons on one side had the same seam: only the outermost addon of the run now rounds its outer corners, so `[prepend]="['$', 'US']"` reads as one piece instead of stacked pills.

## [22.13.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **A read-only theme, applied from the field's own state.** `readonly` reached the native attributes and stopped there, so a read-only field went on drawing the border, the background and the focus ring of something you can type in — a promise it then refused, and next to an editable neighbour there was nothing at all to tell the two apart. Marking a field `readonly` now styles it as such, with no class to remember at the call site: `hub-input`, `hub-textarea`, `hub-select` and `hub-datepicker` all reflect it as `hub-field--readonly`.

    The error border survives: dropping the chrome is about not promising input, while an invalid value is a different message and one the user still has to see — the feedback text alone is easy to miss in a long form.

    It is deliberately **not** the disabled treatment. Disabled means "not applicable now" and fades to say so; read-only means "this is the value, it is simply not yours to change here", so the text keeps full contrast and stays selectable — copying a tax id out of a document is the point of showing it. The chrome that offers input goes: background, border, focus ring, the select's caret and clear cross, and the datepicker's calendar icon. The padding stays, so a read-only field keeps the same box and baseline as the editable ones beside it in a grid.

    Four new tokens, so the look can be taken elsewhere: `--hub-input-readonly-bg`, `--hub-input-readonly-border-color`, `--hub-input-readonly-color`, `--hub-input-readonly-cursor`.

## [22.12.2] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **A disabled select stayed fully usable.** `setDisabledState` set the component's own `disabled` signal, and the template spent it on a `hub-field--disabled` class — the inner select was never told. The field greyed out while its panel still opened and a choice still wrote through to a control the form had explicitly disabled. Greying a field that keeps accepting input is worse than not greying it at all: it promises a protection it does not provide. The disabled state now reaches the inner select, so it refuses interaction like every other field.

## [22.12.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **The slider's value no longer gets cut in half at the ends.** The bubble was centred on the thumb with a flat `translateX(-50%)`, which puts half of it outside the component at 0 and at 100 — and a component cannot assume its host does not clip: a scrollable page body is enough to slice the number in two, which is how it read on an ordinary form. It now translates by the same percentage it is positioned at, so its left edge pins to the start of the rail, its right edge to the end, and it stays centred in between. The two bubbles of a range slider follow the same rule.

## [22.12.0] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **The password reveal toggle never worked**: `resolvedType` is a `computed()` but the reveal flag was a plain class field, so toggling never re-evaluated the native `type`. The state is now the `passwordRevealed` two-way model and the toggle flips `password`/`text` as expected.
- **Readonly password fields no longer expose the secret**: `readonly` used to force `type="text"`, printing the password in clear. Password fields now stay masked when readonly (an explicit toggle click may still reveal); other formats keep the readonly → text behaviour.
- The reveal toggle's border now follows the field's invalid/valid state instead of staying neutral.

### Added

- The reveal toggle renders inside the input group as an integrated trailing addon (visually attached to the field), instead of a detached button.
- `passwordRevealed` two-way model — control or observe the reveal state from outside.
- `passwordToggle` input (default `true`) — set to `false` to hide the toggle.
- `hideOnBlur` input (default `true`) — a revealed password re-masks when focus leaves the field.
- `capsLockWarning` input (default `true`) — hint under the field while Caps Lock is active.
- `passwordStrength` input (default `false`) — opt-in 4-segment strength meter with a default heuristic (`scorePasswordStrength`, exported) and a global `strengthFn` override (called synchronously per keystroke; result clamped to 0–4).
- `autocomplete` input for text-like formats (`current-password`, `new-password`, …).
- `password` section in `HubFormsConfig` (`HubPasswordLabels`): toggle accessible names, Caps Lock hint, strength level labels and the optional `strengthFn` — all localizable via `provideHubForms`.
- New CSS tokens: `--hub-input-password-toggle-width`, `--hub-input-capslock-color`, `--hub-input-strength-{height,gap,track,1,2,3,4}`.

### Removed

- The broken public `showPassword` field. Migrate to the `passwordRevealed` model (`[(passwordRevealed)]`).

## [22.11.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **`ng-select-opened` never reached the host in apps without a global tick** (upstream report), so the 22.11.0 caret flip — keyed on that class — did not engage: the panel opened (`aria-expanded`, `.ng-dropdown-panel`, the imperative `ng-select-bottom`) while the caret kept pointing down. Root cause: the class was a `host` binding, and host bindings apply during the PARENT view's refresh — but `open()` ends in a local `_cd.detectChanges()` that only updates the component's own template, so in zoneless apps (or OnPush islands) the class waited for an unrelated global tick that never came. The class is now reflected imperatively — synchronously from `open()`/`close()` plus an `effect` for `[isOpen]`-driven writes — the same renderer mechanism as the panel's `ng-select-bottom`, which no parent refresh can starve. Regression spec toggles the select in BOTH zone-based and zoneless TestBeds with no manual `detectChanges()` (the manual tick is exactly what masked the bug) and asserts the class tracks open and close.

## [22.11.0] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **The select caret never rendered** (upstream report). The vendored ng-select engine ships `.ng-arrow` as a 0×0 span — the CSS border-triangle technique — and the hub theme only published `border-color`: a colour on a borderless box, i.e. no caret at all, in every consuming app. The theme now publishes the full declaration (`border-style: solid` + token-driven `border-width`), gives the wrapper inline clearance so the triangle doesn't touch the value, and flips the triangle upwards while the panel is open (`.ng-select-opened`), which it had never signalled. Regression spec added asserting the complete closed AND open declarations — a colour-only assertion would have stayed green through this bug.

### Added

- **`--hub-select-arrow-size`** (default `5px`) — the border of the caret triangle — and **`--hub-select-arrow-gap`** (default `var(--hub-ref-space-2, 0.5rem)`) — the wrapper's inline clearance. Dense contexts that already tune `--hub-select-font-size` / `--hub-select-padding-x` / `--hub-select-min-height` can now scale the caret with the same axis.

## [22.10.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- **Accent resolution now imports the canonical `resolveHubAccent` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`.** The private copy under `src/lib/shared/resolve-hub-accent.ts` (used by `<hub-segmented>`) has been deleted in favour of the single, tested implementation shared family-wide. Behaviour is identical (the copy had not diverged): a bareword resolves to `var(--hub-sys-color-<name>, <name>)`, a literal colour passes through unchanged, an empty value yields `null`.

### Added

- **NEW peer dependency: `ng-hub-ui-utils` `>=22.7.0`.** Consumers must have `ng-hub-ui-utils` installed alongside this library (it is where `resolveHubAccent` lives). Users installing via `ng add ng-hub-ui` get it automatically; manual installs need `npm i ng-hub-ui-utils`.

## [22.9.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **`hub-select` async/tagging passthrough (dropdown format).** New inputs forwarded to the vendored ng-select: `addTag` (create items from the search term — `true` or a mapping function, sync or `Promise`), `addTagText`, `minTermLength`, `typeahead` (a `Subject<string>` receiving term changes for server-side loading — the already-documented companion of the `onSearch` output) and `compareWith` (custom item/value equality, applied only when provided so the vendor's default comparison — including `bindValue` matching — stays intact otherwise).
- **`hubSegmentedOption` template.** `<hub-segmented>` accepts a projected `<ng-template hubSegmentedOption let-option let-selected="selected" let-index="index">` that replaces each segment's content (icons, badges, rich markup) while the component keeps owning selection, keyboard navigation and ARIA. Exported as `HubSegmentedOptionDirective` + `HubSegmentedOptionContext` (typed via `ngTemplateContextGuard`).

### Fixed

- **`required` is reflected to assistive technology on every field.** `hub-select` forwards `aria-required` to the vendor's combobox search input (via `inputAttrs`), `hub-segmented` sets it on the `radiogroup` surface (single mode) and `hub-otp` on each cell. Previously only the native-control fields (`input`, `textarea`, `datepicker`, `slider`) and `file-input` conveyed it.
- **`required` derivation now also works with `[formControl]`.** The validator introspection in `HubFormControl` only ran when a `formControlName` string was present, so directly-bound `[formControl]` fields never derived `required` from `Validators.required`. It now runs for both reactive binding styles; template-driven `ngModel` bindings keep honoring the inline `required` input.

## [22.8.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **`--hub-select-dropdown-zindex`** — canonical spelling of the select dropdown stacking hook (the design-system convention is `zindex` without a hyphen, matching `--hub-sys-zindex-*` and the rest of the family). It is read first at the consumption point, so setting it anywhere in the cascade wins without fighting a host declaration.

### Deprecated

- **`--hub-select-dropdown-z-index`** — the old hyphenated spelling. It keeps working exactly as before (it remains the declared default carrier and override bridge), but it is scheduled for removal after one release cycle. Migrate overrides to `--hub-select-dropdown-zindex`.

## [22.7.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **`<hub-file-input>` dropzone chrome is now themeable end to end.** The control shipped a dropzone that could only ever look like the library's: a bare glyph, one line of invitation, and an underlined text link to browse. Four additions let a design system reproduce its own dropzone without forking the template or writing a single bespoke selector — every default is unchanged, so no existing consumer moves a pixel.
    - **Icon medallion.** `--hub-file-input-icon-bg`, `--hub-file-input-icon-chip-size` and `--hub-file-input-icon-chip-radius` put the glyph on a tinted, rounded surface. The glyph moved to the element's `::before`, so `--hub-file-input-icon-color` / `-size` / `-icon` keep meaning exactly what they meant. Defaults (transparent, square, the glyph's own box) render identically.
    - **Browse action as a button.** `--hub-file-input-browse-bg`, `-hover-bg`, `-padding-x`, `-padding-y`, `-radius`, `-font-size`, `-text-decoration` and `-gap`, plus an optional leading glyph (`--hub-file-input-browse-icon`, `-icon-display`, `-icon-size`) that follows the same mask contract as the rest of the family. Defaults keep it a transparent, underlined text affordance.
    - **A second invitation line.** New `dropSubtext` label and a matching per-instance `[dropSubtext]` input, rendered under the invitation as `.hub-file-input__drop-subtext`. Empty by default, so it renders nothing. `[dropText]` was added alongside it, so the invitation is now overridable per instance too (`buttonLabel` already was). New `--hub-file-input-prompt-direction`, `-align` and `-gap` stack the prompt into a column, and `--hub-file-input-drop-text-*` / `-drop-subtext-*` type each line.
    - **A leading slot.** New `hubFileDropzoneNotice` directive (`HubFileDropzoneNoticeDirective`) projects arbitrary markup inside the dropzone, between the glyph and the invitation — the place for a per-instance notice ("2 documents still missing") that neither the invitation nor the constraints hint can express.

## [22.6.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **`<hub-file-input>` dropped the uploader's response body.** `HubFileUploadEvent` carries a `response` on `done` — typically the record the server created — but the component discarded it, leaving the application with no way to reference the file it had just uploaded. `HubFileItem` now exposes a `response` field, populated on `done` and reset to `null` when the upload is retried or cancelled. Reading it does not change the form value, which stays native.

## [22.6.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **New `<hub-file-input>` control.** A full field (extends `HubFieldControl`, so it carries `label` / `formText` / validation chrome and binds with `formControlName`) for picking files: single or `[multiple]`, **drag & drop**, **clipboard paste**, `accept` / `maxSize` / `minSize` / `maxTotalSize` / `maxFiles` constraints, duplicate detection, `capture` for the device camera, and `preview="none | list | grid"` with image thumbnails. The **form value stays native** — `File`, `File[]` or `null` — so it goes straight into a `FormData`; the rich per-file state (id, preview URL, status, progress, error) lives in the `files()` signal instead of contaminating the control. The declared constraints are enforced **by hand**, because the native `accept` attribute only filters the operating-system dialog and is bypassed entirely by a drop or a paste.
- **Optional upload support.** Register a `HubFileUploader` with `provideHubFileUploader()` and the field drives per-file **progress, cancel and retry**; without one it stays a pure picker. `HubFileUploadEvent` carries the raw `loaded` / `total` byte counts rather than a percentage, so a transport that cannot know the total (`HttpClient` emits `total: undefined`) yields `progress: null` and renders an **indeterminate** bar instead of one frozen at 0%. `cancel()` unsubscribes, which aborts the underlying request — the contract therefore requires a **cold** observable. The library ships the contract, never the transport.
- **Six exportable validators** — `hubAcceptedFiles`, `hubMaxFileSize`, `hubMinFileSize`, `hubMaxTotalSize`, `hubMaxFiles`, `hubMinFiles` — with default messages wired into `invalidFeedbackTemplateFn`. The component inputs **filter** (an offending file never reaches the value and surfaces through `(rejected)`); the validators **invalidate**, which also catches a value patched in programmatically.
- **Customization.** 66 `--hub-file-input-*` tokens (every icon — upload, per-file, remove, cancel, retry, done — is a swappable CSS mask), the `hub-file-input-theme(...)` one-call mixin, the projected `<ng-template hubFileIcon>` and `<ng-template hubFilePreview>` templates, and localizable labels through `provideHubForms({ fileInput: … })`. Icons are projected, never imported: the library still has no dependency on `ng-hub-ui-icons`.

### Deprecated

- **`<hub-input type="file">`** (and its `accept`, `multiple` and `buttonLabel` inputs) in favour of `<hub-file-input>`. It keeps working — with a development-mode warning — and will be removed in the next major. It is a bare picker: no drag & drop, no size limits, no preview, no per-file removal, and its `accept` is not enforced on a drop.

## [22.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **`<hub-segmented>` `[color]` accepts ANY colour.** On top of the semantic accent names, the input now also accepts a **registered custom accent** and a **literal colour** (`#ff0000`, `rgb(...)`, `oklch(...)`, or a CSS named colour). The value feeds a single `--hub-segmented-accent` slot; the selected pill takes it as its surface and **derives a legible contrast text automatically** (the same `oklch()` lightness flip the rest of the family uses). Empty (default) keeps the neutral white pill.
- **`hub-forms-theme(...)` mixin** — one-call theming for the shared field chrome (`--hub-form-*`): `focus-ring-color/-width`, `invalid-color`, `valid-color`, `disabled-opacity`, `transition`. Null-defaulted and additive; layer a component mixin (e.g. `hub-segmented-theme`) on top. `@use 'ng-hub-ui-forms/styles' as *;`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (packaging) — SCSS ships at `ng-hub-ui-forms/styles`.** The style bundle and mixins now build to `dist/forms/styles/...` (was `dist/forms/src/lib/styles/...`), so the documented `@use 'ng-hub-ui-forms/styles'` (and `.../styles/mixins/*`) resolves. Update any `@use` that reached into `src/lib/styles`.
- **BREAKING (segmented variants) — accent derives from `--hub-segmented-accent`.** The per-`data-variant` `@each` that hard-set `--hub-segmented-selected-bg/-color` is replaced by a single `:where(.hub-segmented[data-variant])` rule that reads the `--hub-segmented-accent` slot (set from `[color]`). Normal `[color]` usage is unchanged; a **manually** set `data-variant` with no `[color]`/accent now shows the default accent instead of that variant's colour.

## [22.4.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **`<hub-segmented>` — segmented control field.** A compact group of 2..n options rendered as an inline segmented button bar. It is a full `ng-hub-ui-forms` field (extends `HubFieldControl`, binds with `formControlName` / `ngModel`), so it carries the shared `label` / `labelType` / `formText` chrome and the automatic validation feedback. Selection modes: **single** (default — WAI-ARIA `radiogroup` of `role="radio"` buttons, arrow keys move + select, scalar value) and **multiple** (`[multiple]="true"` — `role="group"` of `aria-pressed` toggle buttons, arrow keys move focus while Space/Enter toggle, **array** value). Layout is horizontal by default or vertical with `[vertical]="true"`. Inputs: `options` (`HubSegmentedOption[]` — `{ value, label, disabled? }`), `size` (`'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'`), `label`, `labelType`, `formText`, `multiple`, `vertical`; `value` is a two-way `model`; `disabled` / validation come from the field base. **Semantic variants**: a `color` input (`primary` / `secondary` / `success` / `danger` / `warning` / `info` / `neutral`, or any custom accent) re-tints the selected segment — emitted as `data-variant` and resolved from the `--hub-sys-color-*` families. **Sliding indicator**: in single mode the selected pill is a shared indicator that **animates** from the previous option to the new one (measured to each segment; `--hub-segmented-indicator-transition`, honours `prefers-reduced-motion`); multiple mode keeps per-option backgrounds. **One-call theming**: a new `hub-segmented-theme(...)` SCSS mixin (`@use 'ng-hub-ui-forms/styles' as *`) sets any of the `--hub-segmented-*` slots in a single include. Themed through the `--hub-segmented-*` tokens (`-bg`, `-selected-bg`, `-selected-color`, `-radius`, `-gap`, `-padding-x`, `-padding-y`, `-accent`, `-indicator-transition`). Exposed alongside the `HubSegmentedOption` / `HubSegmentedSize` types.
- **Gradient fill for `<hub-slider>`.** New `--hub-slider-track-fill` token accepts a full background `<image>` (e.g. a `linear-gradient(to right, …)`) for the filled portion of the track. The track now layers this sized background over `--hub-slider-track-bg`, so a gradient renders intact clipped to the current percentage — for both the single-thumb track and the dual-thumb rail (offset across the `from` → `to` band). The default wraps the existing solid `--hub-slider-track-fill-bg` (kept for back-compat) so the previous solid look is preserved.
- **Labelless (flush) `<hub-slider>`.** The value-bubble headroom is now the `--hub-slider-value-space` token (default `1.75rem`). When `showValue` is `false` the rail adds a `--flush` modifier that collapses the space to `0`, so a slider with no value bubble sits flush.

### Fixed

- **`<hub-select>` dropdown no longer hides behind a modal.** The vendored ng-select hard-codes `z-index: 1050` on `.ng-dropdown-panel` — one below `HubModal` (`--hub-sys-zindex-modal`, `1055`) — so a select opened inside a modal was clipped underneath it. The hub theme now sets the panel's stacking through the new `--hub-select-dropdown-z-index` token (`calc(var(--hub-sys-zindex-modal, 1055) + 5)`) with a higher-specificity selector that wins regardless of stylesheet load order and covers both the inline and body-appended panel placements.

### Deprecated

- **`<hub-select>` non-dropdown formats.** `format="buttons" | "checkbox" | "radio"` (and the `vertical` input that goes with them) are deprecated in favour of the now full-featured `<hub-segmented>`, and will be **removed in the next major**. Migration: `format="buttons"` → `<hub-segmented>`; `format="checkbox"` → `<hub-segmented [multiple]="true">`; `format="radio"` → `<hub-segmented [vertical]="true">`. `hub-select` keeps its default `dropdown` format.

## [22.3.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- CSS variable fallbacks realigned to the ds light defaults (`--hub-ref-font-family-base`: `system-ui, sans-serif` → `system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`; `--hub-sys-shadow`: `0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)` → `0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)`); fallbacks only apply when ng-hub-ui-ds is not loaded.

## [22.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **In-field affixes for `<hub-input>`.** Text-like inputs can render leading / trailing content via the new `hubInputPrefix` / `hubInputSuffix` marker directives — project a `<hub-icon>` (any pack, `pack:variant:name` shorthand), an inline SVG or a unit label. The control reserves inline padding so its text never overlaps the affix, and themes a projected `<hub-icon>` through `--hub-input-icon-color` / `--hub-input-icon-size`. Positioned with logical CSS properties (`inset-inline-*` / `padding-inline-*`), so start/end follow the writing direction and flip automatically under `dir="rtl"`. Tokens: `--hub-input-icon-color`, `--hub-input-icon-size`, `--hub-input-affix-inset`, `--hub-input-affix-gap`.
- **Built-in `clearable` for `<hub-input>`.** Set `[clearable]="true"` and the field renders its own ✕ button once it holds a value; it resets the control and emits an empty `search` term — no manual suffix wiring. The glyph is the swappable `--hub-input-clear-icon` mask; colours via `--hub-input-clear-color` / `--hub-input-clear-hover-color` and size via `--hub-input-clear-size`.
- **Debounced typeahead on `<hub-input>`.** A new `search` output emits the current term (stringified) after the user stops typing, debounced by the new `debounceTime` input (ms; `0` emits on every keystroke). Repeated identical terms are skipped. Text-like formats only; `valueChange` stays synchronous. Wire `(search)` to drive autocomplete / live filtering without rolling your own debounce.

### Fixed

- **`<hub-input type="file">` no longer stretches the page.** The visually-hidden native file input was `position: absolute` inside a non-positioned container, so it anchored to `<body>` and extended the document height — breaking the sticky app-shell layout with a phantom scroll. Its container is now `position: relative`.

## [22.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`hubFormControlAdapter`** — a ready-made adapter that renders primitive controls (`hub-input` / `hub-select`) on demand through dynamic component creation, bridging value-in / change-out. It lets other ng-hub-ui libraries host forms controls without a hard dependency: wire it into their optional token, e.g. `provideHubPaginableFormControls(hubFormControlAdapter)` for the `ng-hub-ui-paginable` table. Exposed alongside the structural `HubFormControlAdapter` / `HubFormControlConfig` / `HubFormControlHandle` / `HubFormControlOption` types. Requires `provideHubForms()` or the default config in the environment.

## [22.1.2] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- Adopted the new derived `-on` contrast token for text sitting on the primary accent: `--hub-select-option-selected-color`, `--hub-select-button-selected-color` and `--hub-daterangepicker-active-color` now resolve to `var(--hub-sys-color-primary-on, #fff)` instead of a hard-coded white, so a light or custom primary keeps the selected label/day legible. Validation states (invalid/valid) and field chrome are unchanged.
- Migrated `--hub-daterangepicker-in-range-bg` from `color-mix(in srgb, …)` to `color-mix(in oklch, …)` for perceptually even mixing. No other visual change.

## [22.1.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Design-token consistency pass: aligned inline fallback defaults with the canonical `ng-hub-ui-ds` values and routed hardcoded literals (z-index, font-weight, line-height, radii and theme-aware colours) through their `--hub-sys-*` / `--hub-ref-*` tokens, so they follow the active theme. No visual change when the ds tokens are loaded.

## [22.1.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- New **opt-in valid/success state**, mirroring the invalid contract. A field that opts in via the new `showValid` input (or globally through `provideHubForms({ showValid: true })`) renders a success border + focus ring once it is touched and valid; an optional `validFeedback` message shows below the control. The success state is **never automatic** — only invalid is. Wired into `hub-input`, `hub-textarea`, `hub-datepicker`, `hub-slider` and `hub-otp-input`. Exposes `isValid` / `showsValid` on the shared field control.
- New tokens for the success state: `--hub-form-valid-color`, `--hub-form-valid-border-color`, `--hub-form-valid-focus-ring-color`, `--hub-form-valid-feedback-color` (chained to the `--hub-sys-color-success` family). New CSS hooks `.hub-field__control--valid` and `.hub-field__feedback--valid`.
- Declared `--hub-form-fieldset-padding-x` / `-y` (previously only consumed via fallback in the fieldset component), making fieldset padding a proper themeable token pair.

### Changed

- Replaced the `--hub-daterangepicker-padding` shorthand with the canonical directional `--hub-daterangepicker-padding-x` / `-y` tokens. No visual change. **BREAKING**: set the `-x`/`-y` tokens instead of the removed shorthand.

## [22.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Aligned with Angular 22.
- README documentation standardized.

## [21.0.0] - 2026-06-15

Initial release of the `ng-hub-ui-forms` monolith form-fields suite.

### Added

- **Fields**: `hub-input` (text/number/email/password/color/switch/checkbox/counter, input-group addons), `hub-textarea` (+ `hubAutoresize`), `hub-slider`, `hub-select` (dropdown/buttons/checkbox/radio formats), `hub-datepicker` (single & range), and `hub-otp-input` (segmented one-time-code with auto-advance, backspace/arrow navigation and full-code paste; `length`, `mode`, `secret`, `separatorEvery` inputs).
- **Automatic error display** at every level: fields show their control errors; `hub-fieldset`, `form[hubForm]` and `hub-legend` surface group- and form-level (cross-field) errors with no wiring.
- **`hub-input` pattern masks**: `mask` input (tokens `0` digit · `A` letter · `*` alphanumeric; other chars are literal separators) + `unmaskValue` to store the raw characters; `applyMask` / `isMaskActive` utilities.
- **`hub-select` `appendTo`** input (default `'body'`): the dropdown panel renders to `document.body`, so it escapes `overflow`/`transform` ancestors (cards, scroll containers, modals) and is never clipped. Pass `[appendTo]="undefined"` to render it inline.
- **`hub-select` template passthrough**: projected ng-select template directives (`ng-option-tmp`, `ng-optgroup-tmp`, `ng-label-tmp`, `ng-multi-label-tmp`, `ng-header-tmp`, `ng-footer-tmp`, `ng-notfound-tmp`) are forwarded to the underlying engine, so custom option/label templates work through the wrapper.
- **Config**: `provideHubForms()` / `HUB_FORMS_CONFIG` for invalid-feedback templates, datepicker locale/labels and more (app-wide or per instance).
- **Base classes**: `HubFormControl`, `HubFieldControl`, `HubGroupControl` (reactive `required` tracking, `show`/`hide`/`toggle` helpers).
- **Marker directives**: `hubFormText`, `hubValidationError`, `hubLegend`.
- **Validator**: cross-field `hubAreEqual`.
- **Pipes**: `hubInvertColor`, `hubJoinButLast`, `hubMap`, `hubSafeUrl`, `hubSnakeUpper`, `hubUcfirst`.
- **Signal Forms entry point** `ng-hub-ui-forms/signals` (opt-in): `HubSignalFieldControl`, `hubSignalErrorMessages`. The core never imports `@angular/forms/signals`, staying Angular-21-safe.
- **Theming**: canonical `--hub-*` CSS variables with runtime dark mode; ships shared SCSS tokens (`ng-hub-ui-forms/src/lib/styles`).

### Notes

- `form[hubForm]` augments the native form `submit` (prevents default, marks the tree as touched, reveals form-level errors); bind the form's own `(submit)` for your handler — there is no custom output, which keeps the API idiomatic and avoids the double-emit a directive output named `submit` would cause on a `<form>`.
- The horizontal label layout is a 2-column grid (label · stacked control/help/errors); the label sizes to its content and ellipsizes at `--hub-form-label-horizontal-max-width` (default `12rem`).
- `hub-select` in `buttons` format renders a single joined button group (shared borders, rounded outer corners).
